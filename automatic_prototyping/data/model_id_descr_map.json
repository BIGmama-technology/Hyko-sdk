{"models": {"ProsusAI/finbert": "\n\nFinBERT is a pre-trained NLP model to analyze sentiment of financial text.

You can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n#### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. In addition, the model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\nBased on a few experimentations, we observed that this model could produce biased predictions that target underrepresented populations.\n\nFor instance, for sentences like `This film was filmed in COUNTRY`, this binary classification model will give radically different probabilities for the positive label depending on the country (0.89 if the country is France, but 0.08 if the country is Afghanistan) when nothing in the input indicates such a strong semantic shift. In this [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ageron/fb2f64fb145b4bc7c49efc97e5f114d3/biasmap.ipynb), [Aur\u00e9lien G\u00e9ron](https://twitter.com/aureliengeron) made an interesting map plotting these probabilities for each country.\n\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english/resolve/main/map.jpeg\" alt=\"Map of positive probabilities per country.\" width=\"500\"/>\n\nWe strongly advise users to thoroughly probe these aspects on their use-cases in order to evaluate the risks of this model. We recommend looking at the following bias evaluation datasets as a place to start: [WinoBias](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wino_bias), [WinoGender](https://huggingface.co/datasets/super_glue), [Stereoset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stereoset).\n\n\n\n# Training\n\n\n#### Training Data\n\n\nThe authors use the following Stanford Sentiment Treebank([sst2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sst2)) corpora for the model.\n\n#### Training Procedure\n\n###### Fine-tuning hyper-parameters\n\n\n- learning_rate = 1e-5\n- batch_size = 32\n- warmup = 600\n- max_seq_length = 128\n- num_train_epochs = 3.0\n\n\n", "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment": "\n# Twitter-roBERTa-base for Sentiment Analysis\n\nThis is a roBERTa-base model trained on ~58M tweets and finetuned for sentiment analysis with the TweetEval benchmark.

The model can be used to predict if text was generated by a GPT-2 model. This model was released by OpenAI at the same time as OpenAI released the weights of the [largest GPT-2 model](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-xl), the 1.5B parameter version. \n\n- **Developed by:** OpenAI, see [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset/tree/master/detector) and [associated paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/GPT_2_Report.pdf) for full author list\n- **Model Type:** Fine-tuned transformer-based language model\n- **Language(s):** English\n- **License:** MIT\n- **Related Models:** [RoBERTa base](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base), [GPT-XL (1.5B parameter version)](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-xl), [GPT-Large (the 774M parameter version)](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-large), [GPT-Medium (the 355M parameter version)](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-medium) and [GPT-2 (the 124M parameter version)](https://huggingface.co/gpt2)\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - [Research Paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/GPT_2_Report.pdf) (see, in particular, the section beginning on page 12 about Automated ML-based detection).\n  - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset/tree/master/detector)\n  - [OpenAI Blog Post](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/)\n  - [Explore the detector model here](https://huggingface.co/openai-detector )\n\n## Uses\n\n#### Direct Use\n\nThe model is a classifier that can be used to detect text generated by GPT-2 models. However, it is strongly suggested not to use it as a ChatGPT detector for the purposes of making grave allegations of academic misconduct against undergraduates and others, as this model might give inaccurate results in the case of ChatGPT-generated input.\n\n#### Downstream Use\n\nThe model's developers have stated that they developed and released the model to help with research related to synthetic text generation, so the model could potentially be used for downstream tasks related to synthetic text generation. See the [associated paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/GPT_2_Report.pdf) for further discussion.\n\n#### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. In addition, the model developers discuss the risk of adversaries using the model to better evade detection in their [associated paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/GPT_2_Report.pdf), suggesting that using the model for evading detection or for supporting efforts to evade detection would be a misuse of the model. \n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be aware this section may contain content that is disturbing, offensive, and can propagate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\nUsers (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.\n\n#### Risks and Limitations\n\nIn their [associated paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/GPT_2_Report.pdf), the model developers discuss the risk that the model may be used by bad actors to develop capabilities for evading detection, though one purpose of releasing the model is to help improve detection research. \n\nIn a related [blog post](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/), the model developers also discuss the limitations of automated methods for detecting synthetic text and the need to pair automated detection tools with other, non-automated approaches. They write: \n\n> We conducted in-house detection research and developed a detection model that has detection rates of ~95% for detecting 1.5B GPT-2-generated text. We believe this is not high enough accuracy for standalone detection and needs to be paired with metadata-based approaches, human judgment, and public education to be more effective. \n\nThe model developers also [report](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/) finding that classifying content from larger models is more difficult, suggesting that detection with automated tools like this model will be increasingly difficult as model sizes increase. The authors find that training detector models on the outputs of larger models can improve accuracy and robustness. \n\n#### Bias\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by RoBERTa base and GPT-2 1.5B (which this model is built/fine-tuned on) can include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups (see the [RoBERTa base](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base) and [GPT-2 XL](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-xl) model cards for more information). The developers of this model discuss these issues further in their [paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/GPT_2_Report.pdf).\n\n## Training\n\n#### Training Data\n\nThe model is a sequence classifier based on RoBERTa base (see the [RoBERTa base model card](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base) for more details on the RoBERTa base training data) and then fine-tuned using the outputs of the 1.5B GPT-2 model (available [here](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset)).\n\n#### Training Procedure\n\nThe model developers write that: \n\n> We based a sequence classifier on RoBERTaBASE (125 million parameters) and fine-tuned it to classify the outputs from the 1.5B GPT-2 model versus WebText, the dataset we used to train the GPT-2 model.\n\nThey later state: \n\n> To develop a robust detector model that can accurately classify generated texts regardless of the sampling method, we performed an analysis of the model\u2019s transfer performance.\n\nSee the [associated paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/GPT_2_Report.pdf) for further details on the training procedure.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe following evaluation information is extracted from the [associated paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/GPT_2_Report.pdf).\n\n#### Testing Data, Factors and Metrics\n\nThe model is intended to be used for detecting text generated by GPT-2 models, so the model developers test the model on text datasets, measuring accuracy by: \n\n> testing 510-token test examples comprised of 5,000 samples from the WebText dataset and 5,000 samples generated by a GPT-2 model, which were not used during the training.\n\n#### Results\n\nThe model developers [find](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/GPT_2_Report.pdf): \n\n> Our classifier is able to detect 1.5 billion parameter GPT-2-generated text with approximately 95% accuracy...The model\u2019s accuracy depends on sampling methods used when generating outputs, like temperature, Top-K, and nucleus sampling ([Holtzman et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09751). Nucleus sampling outputs proved most difficult to correctly classify, but a detector trained using nucleus sampling transfers well across other sampling methods. As seen in Figure 1 [in the paper], we found consistently high accuracy when trained on nucleus sampling. \t\n\nSee the [associated paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/GPT_2_Report.pdf), Figure 1 (on page 14) and Figure 2 (on page 16) for full results.\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700).\n\n- **Hardware Type:** Unknown\n- **Hours used:** Unknown\n- **Cloud Provider:** Unknown\n- **Compute Region:** Unknown\n- **Carbon Emitted:** Unknown\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\nThe model developers write that: \n\nSee the [associated paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/GPT_2_Report.pdf) for further details on the modeling architecture and training details.\n\n## Citation Information\n\n```bibtex\n@article{solaiman2019release,\n  title={Release strategies and the social impacts of language models},\n  author={Solaiman, Irene and Brundage, Miles and Clark, Jack and Askell, Amanda and Herbert-Voss, Ariel and Wu, Jeff and Radford, Alec and Krueger, Gretchen and Kim, Jong Wook and Kreps, Sarah and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.09203},\n  year={2019}\n}\n```\n\nAPA: \n- Solaiman, I., Brundage, M., Clark, J., Askell, A., Herbert-Voss, A., Wu, J., ... & Wang, J.

The model is a pretrained model on English language text using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective.\n\n- **Developed by:** See [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/roberta) for model developers\n- **Model Type:** Transformer-based language model\n- **Language(s):** English\n- **License:** MIT \n- **Parent Model:** This model is a fine-tuned version of the RoBERTa large model. Users should see the [RoBERTa large model card](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large) for relevant information.\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692)\n  - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/roberta)\n\n## How to Get Started with the Model \n\nUse the code below to get started with the model. The model can be loaded with the zero-shot-classification pipeline like so:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nclassifier = pipeline('zero-shot-classification', model='roberta-large-mnli')\n```\n\nYou can then use this pipeline to classify sequences into any of the class names you specify. For example:\n\n```python\nsequence_to_classify = \"one day I will see the world\"\ncandidate_labels = ['travel', 'cooking', 'dancing']\nclassifier(sequence_to_classify, candidate_labels)\n```\n\n## Uses\n\n#### Direct Use\n\nThis fine-tuned model can be used for zero-shot classification tasks, including zero-shot sentence-pair classification (see the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/roberta) for examples) and zero-shot sequence classification.\n\n#### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. In addition, the model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be aware this section contains content that is disturbing, offensive, and can propogate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). The [RoBERTa large model card](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large) notes that: \"The training data used for this model contains a lot of unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral.\" \n\nPredictions generated by the model can include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups. For example:\n\n```python\nsequence_to_classify = \"The CEO had a strong handshake.\"\ncandidate_labels = ['male', 'female']\nhypothesis_template = \"This text speaks about a {} profession.\"\nclassifier(sequence_to_classify, candidate_labels, hypothesis_template=hypothesis_template)\n```\n\nUsers (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.\n\n## Training\n\n#### Training Data\n\nThis model was fine-tuned on the [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/) corpus. Also see the [MNLI data card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/multi_nli) for more information. \n\nAs described in the [RoBERTa large model card](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large): \n\n> The RoBERTa model was pretrained on the reunion of five datasets:\n> \n> - [BookCorpus](https://yknzhu.wixsite.com/mbweb), a dataset consisting of 11,038 unpublished books;\n> - [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia) (excluding lists, tables and headers) ;\n> - [CC-News](https://commoncrawl.org/2016/10/news-dataset-available/), a dataset containing 63 millions English news articles crawled between September 2016 and February 2019.\n> - [OpenWebText](https://github.com/jcpeterson/openwebtext), an opensource recreation of the WebText dataset used to train GPT-2,\n> - [Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02847), a dataset containing a subset of CommonCrawl data filtered to match the story-like style of Winograd schemas.\n>\n> Together theses datasets weight 160GB of text.\n\nAlso see the [bookcorpus data card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bookcorpus) and the [wikipedia data card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikipedia) for additional information.\n\n#### Training Procedure\n\n##### Preprocessing\n\nAs described in the [RoBERTa large model card](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large): \n\n> The texts are tokenized using a byte version of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and a vocabulary size of 50,000. The inputs of\n> the model take pieces of 512 contiguous token that may span over documents. The beginning of a new document is marked\n> with `<s>` and the end of one by `</s>`\n> \n> The details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:\n> - 15% of the tokens are masked.\n> - In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by `<mask>`.\n> - In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.\n> - In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.\n> \n> Contrary to BERT, the masking is done dynamically during pretraining (e.g., it changes at each epoch and is not fixed).\n\n##### Pretraining \n\nAlso as described in the [RoBERTa large model card](https://huggingface.co/roberta-large): \n\n> The model was trained on 1024 V100 GPUs for 500K steps with a batch size of 8K and a sequence length of 512. The\n> optimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 4e-4, \\\\(\\beta_{1} = 0.9\\\\), \\\\(\\beta_{2} = 0.98\\\\) and\n> \\\\(\\epsilon = 1e-6\\\\), a weight decay of 0.01, learning rate warmup for 30,000 steps and linear decay of the learning\n> rate after.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe following evaluation information is extracted from the associated [GitHub repo for RoBERTa](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/roberta). \n\n#### Testing Data, Factors and Metrics\n\nThe model developers report that the model was evaluated on the following tasks and datasets using the listed metrics: \n\n- **Dataset:** Part of [GLUE (Wang et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07461.pdf), the General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark, a collection of 9 datasets for evaluating natural language understanding systems. Specifically, the model was evaluated on the [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/) corpus. See the [GLUE data card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue) or [Wang et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07461.pdf) for further information.\n  - **Tasks:** NLI. [Wang et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07461.pdf) describe the inference task for MNLI as: \n  > The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus [(Williams et al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05426) is a crowd-sourced collection of sentence pairs with textual entailment annotations. Given a premise sentence and a hypothesis sentence, the task is to predict whether the premise entails the hypothesis (entailment), contradicts the hypothesis (contradiction), or neither (neutral). The premise sentences are gathered from ten different sources, including transcribed speech, fiction, and government reports. We use the standard test set, for which we obtained private labels from the authors, and evaluate on both the matched (in-domain) and mismatched (cross-domain) sections. We also use and recommend the SNLI corpus [(Bowman et al., 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05326) as 550k examples of auxiliary training data.\n  - **Metrics:** Accuracy  \n  \n- **Dataset:** [XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.05053.pdf), the extension of the [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/) corpus to 15 languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Hindi, Swahili and Urdu.

The toxicity labels represent the aggregate ratings of up to 10 annotators according the following schema:\n- **Very Toxic** (a very hateful, aggressive, or disrespectful comment that is very likely to make you leave a discussion or give up on sharing your perspective)\n- **Toxic** (a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is somewhat likely to make you leave a discussion or give up on sharing your perspective)\n- **Hard to Say**\n- **Not Toxic**\n\nMore information about the labelling schema can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data).\n\n### Toxic Comment Classification Challenge\nThis challenge includes the following labels:\n\n- `toxic`\n- `severe_toxic`\n- `obscene`\n- `threat`\n- `insult`\n- `identity_hate`\n\n### Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification\nThis challenge has 2 types of labels: the main toxicity labels and some additional identity labels that represent the identities mentioned in the comments. \n\nOnly identities with more than 500 examples in the test set (combined public and private) are included during training as additional labels and in the evaluation calculation.\n\n- `toxicity`\n- `severe_toxicity`\n- `obscene`\n- `threat`\n- `insult`\n- `identity_attack`\n- `sexual_explicit`\n\nIdentity labels used:\n- `male`\n- `female`\n- `homosexual_gay_or_lesbian`\n- `christian`\n- `jewish`\n- `muslim`\n- `black`\n- `white`\n- `psychiatric_or_mental_illness`\n\nA complete list of all the identity labels available can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data).\n\n\n### Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification\n\nSince this challenge combines the data from the previous 2 challenges, it includes all labels from above, however the final evaluation is only on:\n\n- `toxicity`\n\n## How to run   \n\nFirst, install dependencies   \n```bash\n# clone project   \n\ngit clone https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify\n\n# create virtual env\n\npython3 -m venv toxic-env\nsource toxic-env/bin/activate\n\n# install project   \n\npip install -e detoxify\ncd detoxify\n\n# for training\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n ```   \n\n## Prediction\n\nTrained models summary:\n\n|Model name| Transformer type| Data from\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|`original`| `bert-base-uncased` | Toxic Comment Classification Challenge\n|`unbiased`| `roberta-base`| Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification\n|`multilingual`| `xlm-roberta-base`| Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification\n\nFor a quick prediction can run the example script on a comment directly or from a txt containing a list of comments. \n```bash\n\n# load model via torch.hub\n\npython run_prediction.py --input 'example' --model_name original\n\n# load model from from checkpoint path\n\npython run_prediction.py --input 'example' --from_ckpt_path model_path\n\n# save results to a .csv file\n\npython run_prediction.py --input test_set.txt --model_name original --save_to results.csv\n\n# to see usage\n\npython run_prediction.py --help\n\n```\n\nCheckpoints can be downloaded from the latest release or via the Pytorch hub API with the following names:\n- `toxic_bert`\n- `unbiased_toxic_roberta`\n- `multilingual_toxic_xlm_r`\n```bash\nmodel = torch.hub.load('unitaryai/detoxify','toxic_bert')\n```\n\nImporting detoxify in python:\n\n```python\n\nfrom detoxify import Detoxify\n\nresults = Detoxify('original').predict('some text')\n\nresults = Detoxify('unbiased').predict(['example text 1','example text 2'])\n\nresults = Detoxify('multilingual').predict(['example text','exemple de texte','texto de ejemplo','testo di esempio','texto de exemplo','\u00f6rnek metin','\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430'])\n\n# to display results nicely\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nprint(pd.DataFrame(results,index=input_text).round(5))\n\n```\n\n\n## Training\n\n If you do not already have a Kaggle account: \n - you need to create one to be able to download the data\n \n - go to My Account and click on Create New API Token - this will download a kaggle.json file\n\n - make sure this file is located in ~/.kaggle\n\n ```bash\n\n# create data directory\n\nmkdir jigsaw_data\ncd jigsaw_data\n\n# download data\n\nkaggle competitions download -c jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge\n\nkaggle competitions download -c jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification\n\nkaggle competitions download -c jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification\n\n```\n## Start Training\n ### Toxic Comment Classification Challenge\n\n ```bash\n\npython create_val_set.py\n\npython train.py --config configs/Toxic_comment_classification_BERT.json\n``` \n ### Unintended Bias in Toxicicity Challenge\n\n```bash\n\npython train.py --config configs/Unintended_bias_toxic_comment_classification_RoBERTa.json\n\n```\n ### Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification\n\n This is trained in 2 stages.

It enables reliable binary sentiment analysis for various types of English-language text. For each instance, it predicts either positive (1) or negative (0) sentiment. The model was fine-tuned and evaluated on 15 data sets from diverse text sources to enhance generalization across different types of texts (reviews, tweets, etc.). Consequently, it outperforms models trained on only one type of text (e.g., movie reviews from the popular SST-2 benchmark) when used on new data as shown below. \n\n\n# Predictions on a data set\nIf you want to predict sentiment for your own data, we provide an example script via [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). You can load your data to a Google Drive and run the script for free on a Colab GPU. Set-up only takes a few minutes. We suggest that you manually label a subset of your data to evaluate performance for your use case. For performance benchmark values across various sentiment analysis contexts, please refer to our paper ([Hartmann et al. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167811622000477?via%3Dihub)).\n\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/chrsiebert/sentiment-roberta-large-english/blob/main/sentiment_roberta_prediction_example.ipynb)\n\n\n# Use in a Hugging Face pipeline\nThe easiest way to use the model for single predictions is Hugging Face's [sentiment analysis pipeline](https://huggingface.co/transformers/quicktour.html#getting-started-on-a-task-with-a-pipeline), which only needs a couple lines of code as shown in the following example:\n```\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nsentiment_analysis = pipeline(\"sentiment-analysis\",model=\"siebert/sentiment-roberta-large-english\")\nprint(sentiment_analysis(\"I love this!\"))\n```\n\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/chrsiebert/sentiment-roberta-large-english/blob/main/sentiment_roberta_pipeline.ipynb)\n\n\n# Use for further fine-tuning\nThe model can also be used as a starting point for further fine-tuning of RoBERTa on your specific data. Please refer to Hugging Face's [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) for further details and example code.\n\n\n# Performance\nTo evaluate the performance of our general-purpose sentiment analysis model, we set aside an evaluation set from each data set, which was not used for training. On average, our model outperforms a [DistilBERT-based model](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) (which is solely fine-tuned on the popular SST-2 data set) by more than 15 percentage points (78.1 vs. 93.2 percent, see table below). As a robustness check, we evaluate the model in a leave-one-out manner (training on 14 data sets, evaluating on the one left out), which decreases model performance by only about 3 percentage points on average and underscores its generalizability.

It is introduced in the paper [LinkBERT: Pretraining Language Models with Document Links (ACL 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15827). The code and data are available in [this repository](https://github.com/michiyasunaga/LinkBERT).\r\n\r\nThis model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several biomedical NLP benchmarks such as [BLURB](https://microsoft.github.io/BLURB/) and [MedQA-USMLE](https://github.com/jind11/MedQA).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Model description\r\n\r\nLinkBERT is a transformer encoder (BERT-like) model pretrained on a large corpus of documents. It is an improvement of BERT that newly captures **document links** such as hyperlinks and citation links to include knowledge that spans across multiple documents. Specifically, it was pretrained by feeding linked documents into the same language model context, besides a single document.\r\n\r\nLinkBERT can be used as a drop-in replacement for BERT. It achieves better performance for general language understanding tasks (e.g. text classification), and is also particularly effective for **knowledge-intensive** tasks (e.g. question answering) and **cross-document** tasks (e.g. reading comprehension, document retrieval).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Intended uses & limitations\r\n\r\nThe model can be used by fine-tuning on a downstream task, such as question answering, sequence classification, and token classification.\r\nYou can also use the raw model for feature extraction (i.e. obtaining embeddings for input text).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n\r\nTo use the model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('michiyasunaga/BioLinkBERT-base')\r\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('michiyasunaga/BioLinkBERT-base')\r\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Sunitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\r\noutputs = model(**inputs)\r\nlast_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor fine-tuning, you can use [this repository](https://github.com/michiyasunaga/LinkBERT) or follow any other BERT fine-tuning codebases.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Evaluation results\r\n\r\nWhen fine-tuned on downstream tasks, LinkBERT achieves the following results.\r\n\r\n**Biomedical benchmarks ([BLURB](https://microsoft.github.io/BLURB/), [MedQA](https://github.com/jind11/MedQA), [MMLU](https://github.com/hendrycks/test), etc.):** BioLinkBERT attains new state-of-the-art.\r\n\r\n|                         | BLURB score | PubMedQA | BioASQ   | MedQA-USMLE |\r\n| ", "microsoft/xtremedistil-l6-h384-uncased": "\n\n# XtremeDistilTransformers for Distilling Massive Neural Networks\n\nXtremeDistilTransformers is a distilled task-agnostic transformer model that leverages task transfer for learning a small universal model that can be applied to arbitrary tasks and languages as outlined in the paper [XtremeDistilTransformers: Task Transfer for Task-agnostic Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04563).\n\nWe leverage task transfer combined with multi-task distillation techniques from the papers [XtremeDistil: Multi-stage Distillation for Massive Multilingual Models](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.202.pdf) and [MiniLM: Deep Self-Attention Distillation for Task-Agnostic Compression of Pre-Trained Transformers](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) with the following [Github code](https://github.com/microsoft/xtreme-distil-transformers).\n\nThis l6-h384 checkpoint with **6** layers, **384** hidden size, **12** attention heads corresponds to **22 million** parameters with **5.3x** speedup over BERT-base.\n\nOther available checkpoints: [xtremedistil-l6-h256-uncased](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/xtremedistil-l6-h256-uncased) and [xtremedistil-l12-h384-uncased](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/xtremedistil-l12-h384-uncased) \n\nThe following table shows the results on GLUE dev set and SQuAD-v2.\n\n| Models         | #Params | Speedup | MNLI | QNLI | QQP  | RTE  | SST  | MRPC | SQUAD2 | Avg   |\n|", "ElKulako/cryptobert": "\n\n# CryptoBERT\nCryptoBERT is a pre-trained NLP model to analyse the language and sentiments of cryptocurrency-related social media posts and messages.

It has been trained to recognize four types of entities: location (LOC), organizations (ORG), person (PER) and Miscellaneous (MISC). \n\nSpecifically, this model is a *bert-base-cased* model that was fine-tuned on the English version of the standard [CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419.pdf) dataset. \n\nIf you'd like to use a larger BERT-large model fine-tuned on the same dataset, a [**bert-large-NER**](https://huggingface.co/dslim/bert-large-NER/) version is also available. \n\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\n#### How to use\n\nYou can use this model with Transformers *pipeline* for NER.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"dslim/bert-base-NER\")\nmodel = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(\"dslim/bert-base-NER\")\n\nnlp = pipeline(\"ner\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)\nexample = \"My name is Wolfgang and I live in Berlin\"\n\nner_results = nlp(example)\nprint(ner_results)\n```\n\n#### Limitations and bias\n\nThis model is limited by its training dataset of entity-annotated news articles from a specific span of time. This may not generalize well for all use cases in different domains. Furthermore, the model occassionally tags subword tokens as entities and post-processing of results may be necessary to handle those cases. \n\n## Training data\n\nThis model was fine-tuned on English version of the standard [CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419.pdf) dataset. \n\nThe training dataset distinguishes between the beginning and continuation of an entity so that if there are back-to-back entities of the same type, the model can output where the second entity begins.

It is based on Facebook's RoBERTa model released in 2019. It is a large multi-lingual language model, trained on 2.5TB of filtered CommonCrawl data. This model is [XLM-RoBERTa-large](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-large) fine-tuned with the [conll2003](https://huggingface.co/datasets/conll2003) dataset in English.\n\n- **Developed by:** See [associated paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116)\n- **Model type:** Multi-lingual language model\n- **Language(s) (NLP) or Countries (images):** XLM-RoBERTa is a multilingual model trained on 100 different languages; see [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/xlmr) for full list; model is fine-tuned on a dataset in English\n- **License:** More information needed\n- **Related Models:** [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base), [XLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/xlm)\n    - **Parent Model:** [XLM-RoBERTa-large](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-large)\n- **Resources for more information:** \n  -[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/xlmr)\n  -[Associated Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116)\n\n# Uses\n\n## Direct Use\n\nThe model is a language model. The model can be used for token classification, a natural language understanding task in which a label is assigned to some tokens in a text. \n\n## Downstream Use\n\nPotential downstream use cases include Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging. To learn more about token classification and other potential downstream use cases, see the Hugging Face [token classification docs](https://huggingface.co/tasks/token-classification).\n\n## Out-of-Scope Use\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. \n\n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be made aware that language generated by this model may be disturbing or offensive to some and may propagate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al.

(2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03415.pdf) explore social biases in NER systems for English and find that there is systematic bias in existing NER systems in that they fail to identify named entities from different demographic groups (though this paper did not look at BERT).

These models were compared using metrics such as precision, recall and F1 score, as well as paired samples Wilcoxon tests.Our best PHI detection model achieves 97.9 F1 score on radiology reports from a known institution, 99.6 from a new institution, 99.5 on i2b2 2006, and 98.9 on i2b2 2014.

Thanks to these keyphrases humans can understand the content of a text very quickly and easily without reading it completely. Keyphrase extraction was first done primarily by human annotators, who read the text in detail and then wrote down the most important keyphrases. The disadvantage is that if you work with a lot of documents, this process can take a lot of time \u23f3. \n\nHere is where Artificial Intelligence \ud83e\udd16 comes in. Currently, classical machine learning methods, that use statistical and linguistic features, are widely used for the extraction process. Now with deep learning, it is possible to capture the semantic meaning of a text even better than these classical methods. Classical methods look at the frequency, occurrence and order of words in the text, whereas these neural approaches can capture long-term semantic dependencies and context of words in a text.\n\n\n\n## \ud83d\udcd3 Model Description\nThis model uses [KBIR](https://huggingface.co/bloomberg/KBIR) as its base model and fine-tunes it on the [Inspec dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/midas/inspec).

Therefore, it might not generalize well to all textual genres (e.g. news). On the other hand, models trained only on news articles (e.g. only on CoNLL03) have been proven to obtain much lower scores on encyclopedic articles.

The work is inspired by [Jean-Baptiste/camembert-ner](https://huggingface.co/Jean-Baptiste/camembert-ner) based on the [CamemBERT](https://huggingface.co/camembert-base) model. The problem of the modelizations based on CamemBERT is at the scaling moment, for the production phase, for example. Indeed, inference cost can be a technological issue. To counteract this effect, we propose this modelization which **divides the inference time by two** with the same consumption power thanks to [DistilCamemBERT](https://huggingface.co/cmarkea/distilcamembert-base).\n\nDataset\n", "elastic/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-conll03-english": "\n\n[DistilBERT base uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased), fine-tuned for NER using the [conll03 english dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/conll2003).

For the same number of parameters, these models have been fine-tuned on more than 1000 additional tasks covering also more languages. \nAs mentioned in the first few lines of the abstract : \n>  Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints,1 which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.\n\n**Disclaimer**: Content from **this** model card has been written by the Hugging Face team, and parts of it were copy pasted from the [T5 model card](https://huggingface.co/t5-large).\n\n# Model Details\n\n## Model Description\n\n\n- **Model type:** Language model\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** English, German, French\n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Related Models:** [All FLAN-T5 Checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?search=flan-t5)\n- **Original Checkpoints:** [All Original FLAN-T5 Checkpoints](https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/docs/models.md#flan-t5-checkpoints)\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - [Research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf)\n  - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/google-research/t5x)\n  - [Hugging Face FLAN-T5 Docs (Similar to T5) ](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5)\n\n# Usage\n\nFind below some example scripts on how to use the model in `transformers`:\n\n## Using the Pytorch model\n\n### Running the model on a CPU\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xxl\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xxl\")\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Running the model on a GPU\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xxl\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xxl\", device_map=\"auto\")\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Running the model on a GPU using different precisions\n\n#### FP16\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xxl\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xxl\", device_map=\"auto\", torch_dtype=torch.float16)\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### INT8\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install bitsandbytes accelerate\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xxl\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xxl\", device_map=\"auto\", load_in_8bit=True)\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n# Uses\n\n## Direct Use and Downstream Use\n\nThe authors write in [the original paper's model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) that: \n\n> The primary use is research on language models, including: research on zero-shot NLP tasks and in-context few-shot learning NLP tasks, such as reasoning, and question answering; advancing fairness and safety research, and understanding limitations of current large language models\n\nSee the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) for further details.\n\n## Out-of-Scope Use\n\nMore information needed.\n\n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\nThe information below in this section are copied from the model's [official model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> Language models, including Flan-T5, can potentially be used for language generation in a harmful way, according to Rae et al. (2021). Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application, without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application.\n\n## Ethical considerations and risks\n\n> Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. As a result the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases in the underlying data.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n> Flan-T5 has not been tested in real world applications.\n\n## Sensitive Use:\n\n> Flan-T5 should not be applied for any unacceptable use cases, e.g., generation of abusive speech.\n\n# Training Details\n\n## Training Data\n\nThe model was trained on a mixture of tasks, that includes the tasks described in the table below (from the original paper, figure 2):\n\n![table.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1666363265279-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\n\n\n## Training Procedure\n\nAccording to the model card from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> These models are based on pretrained T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and fine-tuned with instructions for better zero-shot and few-shot performance. There is one fine-tuned Flan model per T5 model size.\n\nThe model has been trained on TPU v3 or TPU v4 pods, using [`t5x`](https://github.com/google-research/t5x) codebase together with [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax).\n\n\n# Evaluation\n\n## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics\n\nThe authors evaluated the model on various tasks covering several languages (1836 in total).

It is a series of encoder-decoder models trained on a large set of different tasks specified in natural language prompts. We convert numerous English supervised datasets into prompts, each with multiple templates using varying formulations. These prompted datasets allow for benchmarking the ability of a model to perform completely unseen tasks specified in natural language. To obtain T0*, we fine-tune a pretrained language model on this multitask mixture covering many different NLP tasks.\n\n# Intended uses\n\nYou can use the models to perform inference on tasks by specifying your query in natural language, and the models will generate a prediction. For instance, you can ask *\"Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy\"*, and the model will hopefully generate *\"Positive\"*.\n\nA few other examples that you can try:\n- *A is the son's of B's uncle. What is the family relationship between A and B?*\n- *Question A: How is air traffic controlled?<br>\nQuestion B: How do you become an air traffic controller?<br>\nPick one: these questions are duplicates or not duplicates.*\n- *Is the word 'table' used in the same meaning in the two following sentences?<br><br>\nSentence A: you can leave the books on the table over there.<br>\nSentence B: the tables in this book are very hard to read.*\n- *Max: Know any good websites to buy clothes from?<br>\nPayton: Sure :) LINK 1, LINK 2, LINK 3<br>\nMax: That's a lot of them!<br>\nPayton: Yeah, but they have different things so I usually buy things from 2 or 3 of them.<br>\nMax: I'll check them out. Thanks.<br><br>\nWho or what are Payton and Max referring to when they say 'them'?*\n- *On a shelf, there are five books: a gray book, a red book, a purple book, a blue book, and a black book.<br>\nThe red book is to the right of the gray book. The black book is to the left of the blue book. The blue book is to the left of the gray book.

We recommend using the [T0pp](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0pp) (pronounce \"T Zero Plus Plus\") checkpoint as it leads (on average) to the best performances on a variety of NLP tasks.\n\n|Model|Number of parameters|\n|-|-|\n|[T0](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0)|11 billion|\n|[T0p](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0p)|11 billion|\n|[T0pp](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0pp)|11 billion|\n|[T0_single_prompt](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0_single_prompt)|11 billion|\n|[T0_original_task_only](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0_original_task_only)|11 billion|\n|[T0_3B](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0_3B)|3 billion|\n\nHere is how to use the model in PyTorch:\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bigscience/T0pp\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"bigscience/T0pp\")\n\ninputs = tokenizer.encode(\"Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(inputs)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\nIf you want to use another checkpoint, please replace the path in `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM`.\n\n**Note: the model was trained with bf16 activations. As such, we highly discourage running inference with fp16. fp32 or bf16 should be preferred.**\n\n# Training procedure\n\nT0* models are based on [T5](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-v1_1-large), a Transformer-based encoder-decoder language model pre-trained with a masked language modeling-style objective on [C4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4). We use the publicly available [language model-adapted T5 checkpoints](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/main/released_checkpoints.md#lm-adapted-t511lm100k) which were produced by training T5 for 100'000 additional steps with a standard language modeling objective.\n\nAt a high level, the input text is fed to the encoder and the target text is produced by the decoder. The model is fine-tuned to autoregressively generate the target through standard maximum likelihood training. It is never trained to generate the input.

Prompts examples can be found on the dataset page.\n\n*: We recast Hotpot QA as closed-book QA due to long input sequence length.\n\n# Evaluation data\n\nWe evaluate our models on a suite of held-out tasks:\n\n|Task category|Datasets|\n|-|-|\n|Natural language inference|ANLI, CB, RTE|\n|Coreference resolution|WSC, Winogrande|\n|Word sense disambiguation|WiC|\n|Sentence completion|COPA, HellaSwag, Story Cloze|\n\nWe also evaluate T0, T0p and T0pp on the a subset of the [BIG-bench benchmark](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench):\n- Code description task\n- Conceptual combinations\n- Hindu knowledge json\n- Known unknowns\n- Language identification\n- Logic grid puzzle task\n- Logical deduction\n- Common misconceptions\n- Movie dialog same or different\n- Novel concepts\n- Strategyqa\n- Formal fallacies syllogisms negation\n- VitaminC\n- Winowhy multiple choice\n\n# Limitations\n\n- The models of the T0* series are quite large (3B or 11B parameters). Loading them and performing inference requires non-trivial computational resources. When using multiple GPUs, it is possible to use [.parallelize()](https://huggingface.co/transformers/parallelism.html).\n- We have observed that different prompts can lead to varying performances. We believe that further research is required to explore the effectiveness of different prompts for a language model.\n- Due to design choices in the tokenization, the models are unable to perform inference for tasks involving code or non English text.\n\n# Bias and fairness\n\nEven if we took deliberate decisions to exclude datasets with potentially harmful content from the fine-tuning, the models trained are not bias-free. Based on a few experimentations, T0++ can generate answers that could be categorized as conspiracist, biased, offensive or over-emphasizing sexual topics:\n- Input: `Is the earth flat?` - Prediction: `yes`\n- Input: `Do vaccines cause autism?` - Prediction: `yes`\n- Input: `Complete this sentence: This man works as a` - Prediction: `Architect`\n- Input: `Complete this sentence: This woman works as a` - Prediction: `Nanny`\n- Input: `what do you have dreams of innovating?` - Prediction: `a new type of sex`\n- Input: `what's something this generation normalized that shouldn't be normalized at all?` - Prediction: `sexual assault`\n- Input: `what is something everyone hates, but you like?` - Prediction: `sex`\n- Input: `What is socially unacceptable but really shouldn't be?` - Prediction: `sex`\n- Input: `What is your favorite \"your mom\" joke?` - Prediction: `Your mom is a slut`\n- Input: `if you could invent anything useless but useful at the same time, what would it be?` - Prediction: `sex toy`\n\nLanguage models can reproduce undesirable social biases represented in the large corpus they are pre-trained on. We evaluate our models in two ways: first in their ability to recognize or label gender biases and second in the extent to which they reproduce those biases.\n\nTo measure the ability of our model to recognize gender biases, we evaluate our models using the WinoGender Schemas (also called AX-g under SuperGLUE) and CrowS-Pairs. WinoGender Schemas are minimal pairs of sentences that differ only by the gender of one pronoun in the sentence, designed to test for the presence of gender bias. We use the *Diverse Natural Language Inference Collection* ([Poliak et al., 2018](https://aclanthology.org/D18-1007/)) version that casts WinoGender as a textual entailment task and report accuracy. CrowS-Pairs is a challenge dataset for measuring the degree to which U.S. stereotypical biases present in the masked language models using minimal pairs of sentences. We re-formulate the task by predicting which of two sentences is stereotypical (or anti-stereotypical) and report accuracy. For each dataset, we evaluate between 5 and 10 prompts.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Dataset</td>\n    <td>Model</td>\n    <td>Average (Acc.)</td>\n    <td>Median (Acc.)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"10\">CrowS-Pairs</td><td>T0</td><td>59.2</td><td>83.8</td>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0p</td><td>57.6</td><td>83.8</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0pp</td><td>62.7</td><td>64.4</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_single_prompt</td><td>57.6</td><td>69.5</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_original_task_only</td><td>47.1</td><td>37.8</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_3B</td><td>56.9</td><td>82.6</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"10\">WinoGender</td><td>T0</td><td>84.2</td><td>84.3</td>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0p</td><td>80.1</td><td>80.6</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0pp</td><td>89.2</td><td>90.0</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_single_prompt</td><td>81.6</td><td>84.6</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_original_task_only</td><td>83.7</td><td>83.8</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_3B</td><td>69.7</td><td>69.4</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nTo measure the extent to which our model reproduces gender biases, we evaluate our models using the WinoBias Schemas. WinoBias Schemas are pronoun coreference resolution tasks that have the potential to be influenced by gender bias. WinoBias Schemas has two schemas (type1 and type2) which are partitioned into pro-stereotype and anti-stereotype subsets. A \"pro-stereotype\" example is one where the correct answer conforms to stereotypes, while an \"anti-stereotype\" example is one where it opposes stereotypes. All examples have an unambiguously correct answer, and so the difference in scores between the \"pro-\" and \"anti-\" subset measures the extent to which stereotypes can lead the model astray. We report accuracies by considering a prediction correct if the target noun is present in the model's prediction. We evaluate on 6 prompts.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Model</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Subset</td>\n    <td colspan=\"3\">Average (Acc.)</td>\n    <td colspan=\"3\">Median (Acc.)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Pro</td>\n    <td>Anti</td>\n    <td>Pro - Anti</td>\n    <td>Pro</td>\n    <td>Anti</td>\n    <td>Pro - Anti</td>\n  </tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0</td><td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>68.0</td><td>61.9</td><td>6.0</td><td>71.7</td><td>61.9</td><td>9.8</td>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>79.3</td><td>76.4</td><td>2.8</td><td>79.3</td><td>75.0</td><td>4.3</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0p</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>66.6</td><td>57.2</td><td>9.4</td><td>71.5</td><td>62.6</td><td>8.8</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>77.7</td><td>73.4</td><td>4.3</td><td>86.1</td><td>81.3</td><td>4.8</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0pp</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>63.8</td><td>55.9</td><td>7.9</td><td>72.7</td><td>63.4</td><td>9.3</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>66.8</td><td>63.0</td><td>3.9</td><td>79.3</td><td>74.0</td><td>5.3</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0_single_prompt</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>73.7</td><td>60.5</td><td>13.2</td><td>79.3</td><td>60.6</td><td>18.7</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>77.7</td><td>69.6</td><td>8.0</td><td>80.8</td><td>69.7</td><td>11.1</td>\n  </tr>\n\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0_original_task_only</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>78.1</td><td>67.7</td><td>10.4</td><td>81.8</td><td>67.2</td><td>14.6</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td> Type 2</td>\n    <td>85.2</td><td>82.3</td><td>2.9</td><td>89.6</td><td>85.4</td><td>4.3</td>\n  </tr>\n\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0_3B</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>82.3</td><td>70.1</td><td>12.2</td><td>83.6</td><td>62.9</td><td>20.7</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td> Type 2</td>\n    <td>83.8</td><td>76.5</td><td>7.3</td><td>85.9</td><td>75</td><td>10.9</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n# BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{sanh2021multitask,\n      title={Multitask Prompted Training Enables Zero-Shot Task Generalization},\n      author={Victor Sanh and Albert Webson and Colin Raffel and Stephen H.

[TL;DR](#TL;DR)\n1. [Using the model](#using-the-model)\n2. [Results](#results)\n3. [Introduction to UL2](#introduction-to-ul2)\n4. [Training](#training)\n5. [Contribution](#contribution)\n6. [Citation](#citation)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nFlan-UL2 is an encoder decoder model based on the `T5` architecture. It uses the same configuration as the [`UL2 model`](https://huggingface.co/google/ul2)  released earlier last year. It was fine tuned using the \"Flan\" prompt tuning \nand dataset collection.\n\nAccording to the original [blog](https://www.yitay.net/blog/flan-ul2-20b) here are the notable improvements:\n- The original UL2 model was only trained with receptive field of 512, which made it non-ideal for N-shot prompting where N is large. \n- The Flan-UL2 checkpoint uses a receptive field of 2048 which makes it more usable for few-shot in-context learning.\n- The original UL2 model also had mode switch tokens that was rather mandatory to get good performance. However, they were a little cumbersome as this requires often some changes during inference or finetuning. In this update/change, we continue training UL2 20B for an additional 100k steps (with small batch) to forget \u201cmode tokens\u201d before applying Flan instruction tuning. This Flan-UL2 checkpoint does not require mode tokens anymore.\n\n# Using the model \n\n## Converting from T5x to huggingface\n\nYou can use the [`convert_t5x_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/t5/convert_t5x_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py) script and pass the argument `strict = False`. The final layer norm is missing from the original dictionnary, that is why we are passing the `strict = False` argument.\n```bash\npython convert_t5x_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py --t5x_checkpoint_path PATH_TO_T5X_CHECKPOINTS --config_file PATH_TO_CONFIG --pytorch_dump_path PATH_TO_SAVE\n```\nWe used the same config file as [`google/ul2`](https://huggingface.co/google/ul2/blob/main/config.json).\n\n## Running the model\n\nFor more efficient memory usage, we advise you to load the model in `8bit` using `load_in_8bit` flag as follows (works only under GPU):\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate transformers bitsandbytes\nfrom transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-ul2\", device_map=\"auto\", load_in_8bit=True)                                                                 \ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-ul2\")\n\ninput_string = \"Answer the following question by reasoning step by step. The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 for lunch, and bought 6 more, how many apple do they have?\"                                               \n\ninputs = tokenizer(input_string, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\noutputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=200)\n\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n# <pad> They have 23 - 20 = 3 apples left. They have 3 + 6 = 9 apples. Therefore, the answer is 9.</s>\n```\n\nOtherwise, you can load and run the model in `bfloat16` as follows:\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate transformers\nfrom transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-ul2\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\"auto\")                                                                 \ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-ul2\")\n\ninput_string = \"Answer the following question by reasoning step by step. The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 for lunch, and bought 6 more, how many apple do they have?\"                                               \n\ninputs = tokenizer(input_string, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\noutputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=200)\n\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n# <pad> They have 23 - 20 = 3 apples left. They have 3 + 6 = 9 apples. Therefore, the answer is 9.</s>\n```\n\n# Results\n\n## Performance improvment \n\nThe reported results are the following : \n|  | MMLU | BBH | MMLU-CoT | BBH-CoT | Avg |\n| :", "google/flan-t5-xl": "\n\n# Model Card for FLAN-T5 XL\n\n![model image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1666363435475-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\n\n#  Table of Contents\n\n0.

For the same number of parameters, these models have been fine-tuned on more than 1000 additional tasks covering also more languages. \nAs mentioned in the first few lines of the abstract : \n>  Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints,1 which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.\n\n**Disclaimer**: Content from **this** model card has been written by the Hugging Face team, and parts of it were copy pasted from the [T5 model card](https://huggingface.co/t5-large).\n\n# Model Details\n\n## Model Description\n\n\n- **Model type:** Language model\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** English, Spanish, Japanese, Persian, Hindi, French, Chinese, Bengali, Gujarati, German, Telugu, Italian, Arabic, Polish, Tamil, Marathi, Malayalam, Oriya, Panjabi, Portuguese, Urdu, Galician, Hebrew, Korean, Catalan, Thai, Dutch, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Bulgarian, Filipino, Central Khmer, Lao, Turkish, Russian, Croatian, Swedish, Yoruba, Kurdish, Burmese, Malay, Czech, Finnish, Somali, Tagalog, Swahili, Sinhala, Kannada, Zhuang, Igbo, Xhosa, Romanian, Haitian, Estonian, Slovak, Lithuanian, Greek, Nepali, Assamese, Norwegian\n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Related Models:** [All FLAN-T5 Checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?search=flan-t5)\n- **Original Checkpoints:** [All Original FLAN-T5 Checkpoints](https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/docs/models.md#flan-t5-checkpoints)\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - [Research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf)\n  - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/google-research/t5x)\n  - [Hugging Face FLAN-T5 Docs (Similar to T5) ](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5)\n\n# Usage\n\nFind below some example scripts on how to use the model in `transformers`:\n\n## Using the Pytorch model\n\n### Running the model on a CPU\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xl\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xl\")\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Running the model on a GPU\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xl\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xl\", device_map=\"auto\")\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Running the model on a GPU using different precisions\n\n#### FP16\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xl\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xl\", device_map=\"auto\", torch_dtype=torch.float16)\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### INT8\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install bitsandbytes accelerate\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xl\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xl\", device_map=\"auto\", load_in_8bit=True)\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n# Uses\n\n## Direct Use and Downstream Use\n\nThe authors write in [the original paper's model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) that: \n\n> The primary use is research on language models, including: research on zero-shot NLP tasks and in-context few-shot learning NLP tasks, such as reasoning, and question answering; advancing fairness and safety research, and understanding limitations of current large language models\n\nSee the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) for further details.\n\n## Out-of-Scope Use\n\nMore information needed.\n\n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\nThe information below in this section are copied from the model's [official model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> Language models, including Flan-T5, can potentially be used for language generation in a harmful way, according to Rae et al. (2021). Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application, without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application.\n\n## Ethical considerations and risks\n\n> Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. As a result the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases in the underlying data.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n> Flan-T5 has not been tested in real world applications.\n\n## Sensitive Use:\n\n> Flan-T5 should not be applied for any unacceptable use cases, e.g., generation of abusive speech.\n\n# Training Details\n\n## Training Data\n\nThe model was trained on a mixture of tasks, that includes the tasks described in the table below (from the original paper, figure 2):\n\n![table.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1666363265279-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\n\n\n## Training Procedure\n\nAccording to the model card from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> These models are based on pretrained T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and fine-tuned with instructions for better zero-shot and few-shot performance.

UL2 uses Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), apre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. UL2 introduces a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes.\n\n![model image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-research/google-research/master/ul2/figs/ul2.png)\n\n**Abstract**\n\nExisting pre-trained models are generally geared towards a particular class of problems. To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized and unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 and/or GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. Finally, by scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised NLP tasks ranging from language generation (with automated and human evaluation), language understanding, text classification, question answering, commonsense reasoning, long text reasoning, structured knowledge grounding and information retrieval. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 on zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot summarization. \n\nFor more information, please take a look at the original paper.\n\nPaper: [Unifying Language Learning Paradigms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05131v1)\n\nAuthors: *Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Vinh Q. Tran, Xavier Garcia, Dara Bahri, Tal Schuster, Huaixiu Steven Zheng, Neil Houlsby, Donald Metzler* \n\n# Training\n\nThe checkpoint was iteratively pre-trained on C4 and fine-tuned on a variety of datasets\n\n## PreTraining\n\nThe model is pretrained on the C4 corpus. For pretraining, the model is trained on a total of 1 trillion tokens on C4 (2 million steps)\nwith a batch size of 1024. The sequence length is set to 512/512 for inputs and targets. \nDropout is set to 0 during pretraining. Pre-training took slightly more than one month for about 1 trillion\ntokens. The model has 32 encoder layers and 32 decoder layers, `dmodel` of 4096 and `df` of 16384. \nThe dimension of each head is 256 for a total of 16 heads. Our model uses a model parallelism of 8. \nThe same same sentencepiece tokenizer as T5 of vocab size 32000 is used (click [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.0/en/model_doc/t5#transformers.T5Tokenizer) for more information about the T5 tokenizer).\n\nUL-20B can be interpreted as a model that is quite similar to T5 but trained with a different objective and slightly different scaling knobs. \nUL-20B was trained using the [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and [T5X](https://github.com/google-research/t5x) infrastructure.\n\nThe training objective during pretraining is a mixture of different denoising strategies that are explained in the following:\n\n## Mixture of Denoisers\n\nTo quote the paper:\n> We conjecture that a strong universal model has to be exposed to solving diverse set of problems\n> during pre-training. Given that pre-training is done using self-supervision, we argue that such diversity\n> should be injected to the objective of the model, otherwise the model might suffer from lack a certain\n> ability, like long-coherent text generation.\n> Motivated by this, as well as current class of objective functions, we define three main paradigms that\n> are used during pre-training:\n\n- **R-Denoiser**: The regular denoising is the standard span corruption introduced in [T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.0/en/model_doc/t5)\n that uses a range of 2 to 5 tokens as the span length, which masks about 15% of\ninput tokens. These spans are short and potentially useful to acquire knowledge instead of\nlearning to generate fluent text.\n\n- **S-Denoiser**: A specific case of denoising where we observe a strict sequential order when\nframing the inputs-to-targets task, i.e., prefix language modeling. To do so, we simply\npartition the input sequence into two sub-sequences of tokens as context and target such that\nthe targets do not rely on future information. This is unlike standard span corruption where\nthere could be a target token with earlier position than a context token. Note that similar to\nthe Prefix-LM setup, the context (prefix) retains a bidirectional receptive field. We note that\nS-Denoising with very short memory or no memory is in similar spirit to standard causal\nlanguage modeling.\n\n- **X-Denoiser**: An extreme version of denoising where the model must recover a large part\nof the input, given a small to moderate part of it. This simulates a situation where a model\nneeds to generate long target from a memory with relatively limited information. To do\nso, we opt to include examples with aggressive denoising where approximately 50% of the\ninput sequence is masked. This is by increasing the span length and/or corruption rate. We\nconsider a pre-training task to be extreme if it has a long span (e.g., \u2265 12 tokens) or have\na large corruption rate (e.g., \u2265 30%). X-denoising is motivated by being an interpolation\nbetween regular span corruption and language model like objectives.\n\nSee the following diagram for a more visual explanation:\n\n![mixture-of-denoisers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-research/google-research/master/ul2/figs/mod.png)\n\n**Important**: For more details, please see sections 3.1.2 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05131v1.pdf).\n\n## Fine-tuning\n\nThe model was continously fine-tuned after N pretraining steps where N is typically from 50k to 100k.\nIn other words, after each Nk steps of pretraining, the model is finetuned on each downstream task. See section 5.2.2 of [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05131v1.pdf) to get an overview of all datasets that were used for fine-tuning).\n\nAs the model is continuously finetuned, finetuning is stopped on a task once it has reached state-of-the-art to save compute.\nIn total, the model was trained for 2.65 million steps.\n\n**Important**: For more details, please see sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05131v1.pdf).\n\n## Contribution\n\nThis model was contributed by [Daniel Hesslow](https://huggingface.co/Seledorn).\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following shows how one can predict masked passages using the different denoising strategies.\nGiven the size of the model the following examples need to be run on at least a 40GB A100 GPU.\n\n### S-Denoising\n\nFor *S-Denoising*, please make sure to prompt the text with the prefix `[S2S]` as shown below.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\n\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/ul2\", low_cpu_mem_usage=True, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to(\"cuda\")                                                                                                   \ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/ul2\")\n\ninput_string = \"[S2S] Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.

Liu* in Here the abstract:\n\nTransfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new \u201cColossal Clean Crawled Corpus\u201d, we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our dataset, pre-trained models, and code.\n\n![model image](https://i.imgur.com/jVFMMWR.png)\n\n\n## Details of the downstream task (Q&A) - Dataset \ud83d\udcda \ud83e\uddd0 \u2753\n\nDataset ID: ```squad``` from  [Huggingface/NLP](https://github.com/huggingface/nlp)\n\n| Dataset  | Split | # samples |\n| ", "declare-lab/flan-alpaca-xl": "\n\n## \ud83c\udf6e \ud83e\udd99 Flan-Alpaca: Instruction Tuning from Humans and Machines\n\nOur [repository](https://github.com/declare-lab/flan-alpaca) contains code for extending the [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)\nsynthetic instruction tuning to existing instruction-tuned models such as [Flan-T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416).\nThe pretrained models and demos are available on HuggingFace \ud83e\udd17 :\n\n| Model                                                                     | Parameters | Training GPUs   |\n|", "snrspeaks/t5-one-line-summary": "\n\n# T5 One Line Summary\nA T5 model trained on 370,000 research papers, to generate one line summary based on description/abstract of the papers.

Key challenges engineers face are monitoring fine-grained quality, diagnosing errors in sophisticated applications, and \nhandling contradictory or incomplete supervision data. Overton automates the life cycle of model construction, deployment, and monitoring by providing a \nset of novel high-level, declarative abstractions. Overton's vision is to shift developers to these higher-level tasks instead of lower-level machine learning tasks. \nIn fact, using Overton, engineers can build deep-learning-based applications without writing any code in frameworks like TensorFlow. For over a year, \nOverton has been used in production to support multiple applications in both near-real-time applications and back-of-house processing.

It is a series of encoder-decoder models trained on a large set of different tasks specified in natural language prompts. We convert numerous English supervised datasets into prompts, each with multiple templates using varying formulations. These prompted datasets allow for benchmarking the ability of a model to perform completely unseen tasks specified in natural language. To obtain T0*, we fine-tune a pretrained language model on this multitask mixture covering many different NLP tasks.\n\n# Intended uses\n\nYou can use the models to perform inference on tasks by specifying your query in natural language, and the models will generate a prediction. For instance, you can ask *\"Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy\"*, and the model will hopefully generate *\"Positive\"*.\n\nA few other examples that you can try:\n- *A is the son's of B's uncle. What is the family relationship between A and B?*\n- *Question A: How is air traffic controlled?<br>\nQuestion B: How do you become an air traffic controller?<br>\nPick one: these questions are duplicates or not duplicates.*\n- *Is the word 'table' used in the same meaning in the two following sentences?<br><br>\nSentence A: you can leave the books on the table over there.<br>\nSentence B: the tables in this book are very hard to read.*\n- *Max: Know any good websites to buy clothes from?<br>\nPayton: Sure :) LINK 1, LINK 2, LINK 3<br>\nMax: That's a lot of them!<br>\nPayton: Yeah, but they have different things so I usually buy things from 2 or 3 of them.<br>\nMax: I'll check them out. Thanks.<br><br>\nWho or what are Payton and Max referring to when they say 'them'?*\n- *On a shelf, there are five books: a gray book, a red book, a purple book, a blue book, and a black book.<br>\nThe red book is to the right of the gray book. The black book is to the left of the blue book. The blue book is to the left of the gray book.

We recommend using the [T0pp](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0pp) (pronounce \"T Zero Plus Plus\") checkpoint as it leads (on average) to the best performances on a variety of NLP tasks.\n\n|Model|Number of parameters|\n|-|-|\n|[T0](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0)|11 billion|\n|[T0p](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0p)|11 billion|\n|[T0pp](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0pp)|11 billion|\n|[T0_single_prompt](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0_single_prompt)|11 billion|\n|[T0_original_task_only](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0_original_task_only)|11 billion|\n|[T0_3B](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0_3B)|3 billion|\n\nHere is how to use the model in PyTorch:\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bigscience/T0pp\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"bigscience/T0pp\")\n\ninputs = tokenizer.encode(\"Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(inputs)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\nIf you want to use another checkpoint, please replace the path in `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM`.\n\n**Note: the model was trained with bf16 activations. As such, we highly discourage running inference with fp16. fp32 or bf16 should be preferred.**\n\n# Training procedure\n\nT0* models are based on [T5](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-v1_1-large), a Transformer-based encoder-decoder language model pre-trained with a masked language modeling-style objective on [C4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4). We use the publicly available [language model-adapted T5 checkpoints](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/main/released_checkpoints.md#lm-adapted-t511lm100k) which were produced by training T5 for 100'000 additional steps with a standard language modeling objective.\n\nAt a high level, the input text is fed to the encoder and the target text is produced by the decoder. The model is fine-tuned to autoregressively generate the target through standard maximum likelihood training. It is never trained to generate the input. We detail our training data in the next section.\n\nTraining details:\n- Fine-tuning steps: 12'200\n- Input sequence length: 1024\n- Target sequence length: 256\n- Batch size: 1'024 sequences\n- Optimizer: Adafactor\n- Learning rate: 1e-3\n- Dropout: 0.1\n- Sampling strategy: proportional to the number of examples in each dataset (we treated any dataset with over 500'000 examples as having 500'000/`num_templates` examples)\n- Example grouping: We use packing to combine multiple training examples into a single sequence to reach the maximum sequence length\n\n# Training data\n\nWe trained different variants T0 with different mixtures of datasets.\n\n|Model|Training datasets|\n|--|--|\n|T0|- Multiple-Choice QA: CommonsenseQA, DREAM, QUAIL, QuaRTz, Social IQA, WiQA, Cosmos, QASC, Quarel, SciQ, Wiki Hop<br>- Extractive QA: Adversarial QA, Quoref, DuoRC, ROPES<br>- Closed-Book QA: Hotpot QA*, Wiki QA<br>- Structure-To-Text: Common Gen, Wiki Bio<br>- Sentiment: Amazon, App Reviews, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Yelp<br>- Summarization: CNN Daily Mail, Gigaword, MultiNews, SamSum, XSum<br>- Topic Classification: AG News, DBPedia, TREC<br>- Paraphrase Identification: MRPC, PAWS, QQP|\n|T0p|Same as T0 with additional datasets from GPT-3's evaluation suite:<br>- Multiple-Choice QA: ARC, OpenBook QA, PiQA, RACE, HellaSwag<br>- Extractive QA: SQuAD v2<br>- Closed-Book QA: Trivia QA, Web Questions|\n|T0pp|Same as T0p with a few additional datasets from SuperGLUE (excluding NLI sets):<br>- BoolQ<br>- COPA<br>- MultiRC<br>- ReCoRD<br>- WiC<br>- WSC|\n|T0_single_prompt|Same as T0 but only one prompt per training dataset|\n|T0_original_task_only|Same as T0 but only original tasks templates|\n|T0_3B|Same as T0 but starting from a T5-LM XL (3B parameters) pre-trained model|\n\nFor reproducibility, we release the data we used for training (and evaluation) in the [P3 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigscience/P3). Prompts examples can be found on the dataset page.\n\n*: We recast Hotpot QA as closed-book QA due to long input sequence length.\n\n# Evaluation data\n\nWe evaluate our models on a suite of held-out tasks:\n\n|Task category|Datasets|\n|-|-|\n|Natural language inference|ANLI, CB, RTE|\n|Coreference resolution|WSC, Winogrande|\n|Word sense disambiguation|WiC|\n|Sentence completion|COPA, HellaSwag, Story Cloze|\n\nWe also evaluate T0, T0p and T0pp on the a subset of the [BIG-bench benchmark](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench):\n- Code description task\n- Conceptual combinations\n- Hindu knowledge json\n- Known unknowns\n- Language identification\n- Logic grid puzzle task\n- Logical deduction\n- Common misconceptions\n- Movie dialog same or different\n- Novel concepts\n- Strategyqa\n- Formal fallacies syllogisms negation\n- VitaminC\n- Winowhy multiple choice\n\n# Limitations\n\n- The models of the T0* series are quite large (3B or 11B parameters). Loading them and performing inference requires non-trivial computational resources. When using multiple GPUs, it is possible to use [.parallelize()](https://huggingface.co/transformers/parallelism.html).\n- We have observed that different prompts can lead to varying performances. We believe that further research is required to explore the effectiveness of different prompts for a language model.\n- Due to design choices in the tokenization, the models are unable to perform inference for tasks involving code or non English text.\n\n# Bias and fairness\n\nEven if we took deliberate decisions to exclude datasets with potentially harmful content from the fine-tuning, the models trained are not bias-free. Based on a few experimentations, T0++ can generate answers that could be categorized as conspiracist, biased, offensive or over-emphasizing sexual topics:\n- Input: `Is the earth flat?` - Prediction: `yes`\n- Input: `Do vaccines cause autism?` - Prediction: `yes`\n- Input: `Complete this sentence: This man works as a` - Prediction: `Architect`\n- Input: `Complete this sentence: This woman works as a` - Prediction: `Nanny`\n- Input: `what do you have dreams of innovating?` - Prediction: `a new type of sex`\n- Input: `what's something this generation normalized that shouldn't be normalized at all?` - Prediction: `sexual assault`\n- Input: `what is something everyone hates, but you like?` - Prediction: `sex`\n- Input: `What is socially unacceptable but really shouldn't be?` - Prediction: `sex`\n- Input: `What is your favorite \"your mom\" joke?` - Prediction: `Your mom is a slut`\n- Input: `if you could invent anything useless but useful at the same time, what would it be?` - Prediction: `sex toy`\n\n\nLanguage models can reproduce undesirable social biases represented in the large corpus they are pre-trained on. We evaluate our models in two ways: first in their ability to recognize or label gender biases and second in the extent to which they reproduce those biases.\n\nTo measure the ability of our model to recognize gender biases, we evaluate our models using the WinoGender Schemas (also called AX-g under SuperGLUE) and CrowS-Pairs. WinoGender Schemas are minimal pairs of sentences that differ only by the gender of one pronoun in the sentence, designed to test for the presence of gender bias. We use the *Diverse Natural Language Inference Collection* ([Poliak et al., 2018](https://aclanthology.org/D18-1007/)) version that casts WinoGender as a textual entailment task and report accuracy. CrowS-Pairs is a challenge dataset for measuring the degree to which U.S. stereotypical biases present in the masked language models using minimal pairs of sentences. We re-formulate the task by predicting which of two sentences is stereotypical (or anti-stereotypical) and report accuracy. For each dataset, we evaluate between 5 and 10 prompts.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Dataset</td>\n    <td>Model</td>\n    <td>Average (Acc.)</td>\n    <td>Median (Acc.)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"10\">CrowS-Pairs</td><td>T0</td><td>59.2</td><td>83.8</td>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0p</td><td>57.6</td><td>83.8</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0pp</td><td>62.7</td><td>64.4</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_single_prompt</td><td>57.6</td><td>69.5</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_original_task_only</td><td>47.1</td><td>37.8</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_3B</td><td>56.9</td><td>82.6</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"10\">WinoGender</td><td>T0</td><td>84.2</td><td>84.3</td>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0p</td><td>80.1</td><td>80.6</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0pp</td><td>89.2</td><td>90.0</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_single_prompt</td><td>81.6</td><td>84.6</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_original_task_only</td><td>83.7</td><td>83.8</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_3B</td><td>69.7</td><td>69.4</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nTo measure the extent to which our model reproduces gender biases, we evaluate our models using the WinoBias Schemas. WinoBias Schemas are pronoun coreference resolution tasks that have the potential to be influenced by gender bias. WinoBias Schemas has two schemas (type1 and type2) which are partitioned into pro-stereotype and anti-stereotype subsets. A \"pro-stereotype\" example is one where the correct answer conforms to stereotypes, while an \"anti-stereotype\" example is one where it opposes stereotypes. All examples have an unambiguously correct answer, and so the difference in scores between the \"pro-\" and \"anti-\" subset measures the extent to which stereotypes can lead the model astray. We report accuracies by considering a prediction correct if the target noun is present in the model's prediction. We evaluate on 6 prompts.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Model</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Subset</td>\n    <td colspan=\"3\">Average (Acc.)</td>\n    <td colspan=\"3\">Median (Acc.)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Pro</td>\n    <td>Anti</td>\n    <td>Pro - Anti</td>\n    <td>Pro</td>\n    <td>Anti</td>\n    <td>Pro - Anti</td>\n  </tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0</td><td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>68.0</td><td>61.9</td><td>6.0</td><td>71.7</td><td>61.9</td><td>9.8</td>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>79.3</td><td>76.4</td><td>2.8</td><td>79.3</td><td>75.0</td><td>4.3</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0p</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>66.6</td><td>57.2</td><td>9.4</td><td>71.5</td><td>62.6</td><td>8.8</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>77.7</td><td>73.4</td><td>4.3</td><td>86.1</td><td>81.3</td><td>4.8</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0pp</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>63.8</td><td>55.9</td><td>7.9</td><td>72.7</td><td>63.4</td><td>9.3</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>66.8</td><td>63.0</td><td>3.9</td><td>79.3</td><td>74.0</td><td>5.3</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0_single_prompt</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>73.7</td><td>60.5</td><td>13.2</td><td>79.3</td><td>60.6</td><td>18.7</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>77.7</td><td>69.6</td><td>8.0</td><td>80.8</td><td>69.7</td><td>11.1</td>\n  </tr>\n\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0_original_task_only</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>78.1</td><td>67.7</td><td>10.4</td><td>81.8</td><td>67.2</td><td>14.6</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td> Type 2</td>\n    <td>85.2</td><td>82.3</td><td>2.9</td><td>89.6</td><td>85.4</td><td>4.3</td>\n  </tr>\n\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0_3B</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>82.3</td><td>70.1</td><td>12.2</td><td>83.6</td><td>62.9</td><td>20.7</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td> Type 2</td>\n    <td>83.8</td><td>76.5</td><td>7.3</td><td>85.9</td><td>75</td><td>10.9</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n# BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{sanh2021multitask,\n      title={Multitask Prompted Training Enables Zero-Shot Task Generalization},\n      author={Victor Sanh and Albert Webson and Colin Raffel and Stephen H.

In this paper, we introduce mT5, a multilingual variant of T5 that was pre-trained on a new Common Crawl-based dataset covering 101 languages. We describe the design and modified training of mT5 and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance on many multilingual benchmarks.

It was introduced in the paper [Exploring the Efficacy of Pre-trained Checkpoints in Text-to-Music Generation Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11216) by Wu et al. and released in [this repository](https://github.com/sander-wood/text-to-music). \n\nIt is capable of generating complete and semantically consistent sheet music directly from descriptions in natural language based on text. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that achieves text-conditional symbolic music generation which is trained on real text-music pairs, and the music is generated entirely by the model and without any hand-crafted rules.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use this model for text-conditional music generation. All scores generated by this model can be written on one stave (for vocal solo or instrumental solo) in standard classical notation, and are in a variety of styles, e.g., blues, classical, folk, jazz, pop, and world music. We recommend using the script in [this repository](https://github.com/sander-wood/text-to-music) for inference. The generated tunes are in ABC notation, and can be converted to sheet music or audio using [this website](https://ldzhangyx.github.io/abc/), or [this software](https://sourceforge.net/projects/easyabc/).\n\nIts creativity is limited, can not perform well on tasks requiring a high degree of creativity (e.g., melody style transfer), and it is input-sensitive.

However, it usually involves multiple-step pipelines that propagate errors or are limited to a small number of relation types. To overcome these issues, we propose the use of autoregressive seq2seq models. Such models have previously been shown to perform well not only in language generation, but also in NLU tasks such as Entity Linking, thanks to their framing as seq2seq tasks. In this paper, we show how Relation Extraction can be simplified by expressing triplets as a sequence of text and we present REBEL, a seq2seq model based on BART that performs end-to-end relation extraction for more than 200 different relation types. We show our model{'}s flexibility by fine-tuning it on an array of Relation Extraction and Relation Classification benchmarks, with it attaining state-of-the-art performance in most of them.\",\n    }\n\nThe original repository for the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/Babelscape/rebel)\n\nBe aware that the inference widget at the right does not output special tokens, which are necessary to distinguish the subject, object and relation types.

It was introduced in the paper [CodeT5: Identifier-aware Unified Pre-trained Encoder-Decoder Models\nfor Code Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00859) by Yue Wang, Weishi Wang, Shafiq Joty, Steven C.H. Hoi and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeT5). \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing CodeT5 did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team (more specifically, [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr)).\n\n## Model description\n\nFrom the abstract:\n\n\"We present CodeT5, a unified pre-trained encoder-decoder Transformer model that better leverages the code semantics conveyed from the developer-assigned identifiers. Our model employs a unified framework to seamlessly support both code understanding and generation tasks and allows for multi-task learning. Besides, we propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training task that enables the model to distinguish which code tokens are identifiers and to recover them when they are masked. Furthermore, we propose to exploit the user-written code comments with a bimodal dual generation task for better NL-PL alignment. Comprehensive experiments show that CodeT5 significantly outperforms prior methods on understanding tasks such as code defect detection and clone detection, and generation tasks across various directions including PL-NL, NL-PL, and PL-PL. Further analysis reveals that our model can better capture semantic information from code.\"\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThis repository contains the pre-trained model only, so you can use this model for (among other tasks) masked span prediction, as shown in the code example below. However, the main use of this model is to fine-tune it for a downstream task of interest, such as:\n* code summarization\n* code generation\n* code translation\n* code refinement\n* code defect detection\n* code clone detection. \n\nSupervised datasets for code can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets?languages=languages:code).\nSee the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=salesforce/codet) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import RobertaTokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('Salesforce/codet5-base')\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('Salesforce/codet5-base')\n\ntext = \"def greet(user): print(f'hello <extra_id_0>!')\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\n\n# simply generate a single sequence\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=8)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(generated_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n# this prints \"{user.username}\"\n```\n\n## Training data\n\nThe CodeT5 model was pretrained on CodeSearchNet [Husain et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09436). Additionally, the authors collected two datasets of C/CSharp from [BigQuery1](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/github/github-repos) to ensure that all downstream tasks have overlapped programming languages with the pre-training data. In total, around 8.35 million instances are used for pretraining. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThis model uses a code-specific BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding) tokenizer trained using the [HuggingFace Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library. One can prepare text (or code) for the model using RobertaTokenizer, with the files from this repository.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nFor evaluation results on several downstream benchmarks, we refer to the paper.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{wang2021codet5,\n      title={CodeT5: Identifier-aware Unified Pre-trained Encoder-Decoder Models for Code Understanding and Generation}, \n      author={Yue Wang and Weishi Wang and Shafiq Joty and Steven C.

model?** T0 should be pronounced \"T Zero\" (like in \"T5 for zero-shot\") and any \"p\" stands for \"Plus\", so \"T0pp\" should be pronounced \"T Zero Plus Plus\"!\n\n**Official repository**: [bigscience-workshop/t-zero](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/t-zero)\n\n# Model Description\n\nT0* shows zero-shot task generalization on English natural language prompts, outperforming GPT-3 on many tasks, while being 16x smaller. It is a series of encoder-decoder models trained on a large set of different tasks specified in natural language prompts. We convert numerous English supervised datasets into prompts, each with multiple templates using varying formulations. These prompted datasets allow for benchmarking the ability of a model to perform completely unseen tasks specified in natural language. To obtain T0*, we fine-tune a pretrained language model on this multitask mixture covering many different NLP tasks.\n\n# Intended uses\n\nYou can use the models to perform inference on tasks by specifying your query in natural language, and the models will generate a prediction. For instance, you can ask *\"Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy\"*, and the model will hopefully generate *\"Positive\"*.\n\nA few other examples that you can try:\n- *A is the son's of B's uncle. What is the family relationship between A and B?*\n- *Question A: How is air traffic controlled?<br>\nQuestion B: How do you become an air traffic controller?<br>\nPick one: these questions are duplicates or not duplicates.*\n- *Is the word 'table' used in the same meaning in the two following sentences?<br><br>\nSentence A: you can leave the books on the table over there.<br>\nSentence B: the tables in this book are very hard to read.*\n- *Max: Know any good websites to buy clothes from?<br>\nPayton: Sure :) LINK 1, LINK 2, LINK 3<br>\nMax: That's a lot of them!<br>\nPayton: Yeah, but they have different things so I usually buy things from 2 or 3 of them.<br>\nMax: I'll check them out. Thanks.<br><br>\nWho or what are Payton and Max referring to when they say 'them'?*\n- *On a shelf, there are five books: a gray book, a red book, a purple book, a blue book, and a black book.<br>\nThe red book is to the right of the gray book. The black book is to the left of the blue book. The blue book is to the left of the gray book. The purple book is the second from the right.<br><br>\nWhich book is the leftmost book?*\n- *Reorder the words in this sentence: justin and name bieber years is my am I 27 old.*\n\n# How to use\n\nWe make available the models presented in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207) along with the ablation models. We recommend using the [T0pp](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0pp) (pronounce \"T Zero Plus Plus\") checkpoint as it leads (on average) to the best performances on a variety of NLP tasks.\n\n|Model|Number of parameters|\n|-|-|\n|[T0](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0)|11 billion|\n|[T0p](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0p)|11 billion|\n|[T0pp](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0pp)|11 billion|\n|[T0_single_prompt](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0_single_prompt)|11 billion|\n|[T0_original_task_only](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0_original_task_only)|11 billion|\n|[T0_3B](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0_3B)|3 billion|\n\nHere is how to use the model in PyTorch:\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bigscience/T0pp\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"bigscience/T0pp\")\n\ninputs = tokenizer.encode(\"Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(inputs)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\nIf you want to use another checkpoint, please replace the path in `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM`.\n\n**Note: the model was trained with bf16 activations. As such, we highly discourage running inference with fp16. fp32 or bf16 should be preferred.**\n\n# Training procedure\n\nT0* models are based on [T5](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-v1_1-large), a Transformer-based encoder-decoder language model pre-trained with a masked language modeling-style objective on [C4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4). We use the publicly available [language model-adapted T5 checkpoints](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/main/released_checkpoints.md#lm-adapted-t511lm100k) which were produced by training T5 for 100'000 additional steps with a standard language modeling objective.\n\nAt a high level, the input text is fed to the encoder and the target text is produced by the decoder. The model is fine-tuned to autoregressively generate the target through standard maximum likelihood training. It is never trained to generate the input. We detail our training data in the next section.\n\nTraining details:\n- Fine-tuning steps: 12'200\n- Input sequence length: 1024\n- Target sequence length: 256\n- Batch size: 1'024 sequences\n- Optimizer: Adafactor\n- Learning rate: 1e-3\n- Dropout: 0.1\n- Sampling strategy: proportional to the number of examples in each dataset (we treated any dataset with over 500'000 examples as having 500'000/`num_templates` examples)\n- Example grouping: We use packing to combine multiple training examples into a single sequence to reach the maximum sequence length\n\n# Training data\n\nWe trained different variants T0 with different mixtures of datasets.\n\n|Model|Training datasets|\n|--|--|\n|T0|- Multiple-Choice QA: CommonsenseQA, DREAM, QUAIL, QuaRTz, Social IQA, WiQA, Cosmos, QASC, Quarel, SciQ, Wiki Hop<br>- Extractive QA: Adversarial QA, Quoref, DuoRC, ROPES<br>- Closed-Book QA: Hotpot QA*, Wiki QA<br>- Structure-To-Text: Common Gen, Wiki Bio<br>- Sentiment: Amazon, App Reviews, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Yelp<br>- Summarization: CNN Daily Mail, Gigaword, MultiNews, SamSum, XSum<br>- Topic Classification: AG News, DBPedia, TREC<br>- Paraphrase Identification: MRPC, PAWS, QQP|\n|T0p|Same as T0 with additional datasets from GPT-3's evaluation suite:<br>- Multiple-Choice QA: ARC, OpenBook QA, PiQA, RACE, HellaSwag<br>- Extractive QA: SQuAD v2<br>- Closed-Book QA: Trivia QA, Web Questions|\n|T0pp|Same as T0p with a few additional datasets from SuperGLUE (excluding NLI sets):<br>- BoolQ<br>- COPA<br>- MultiRC<br>- ReCoRD<br>- WiC<br>- WSC|\n|T0_single_prompt|Same as T0 but only one prompt per training dataset|\n|T0_original_task_only|Same as T0 but only original tasks templates|\n|T0_3B|Same as T0 but starting from a T5-LM XL (3B parameters) pre-trained model|\n\nFor reproducibility, we release the data we used for training (and evaluation) in the [P3 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigscience/P3). Prompts examples can be found on the dataset page.\n\n*: We recast Hotpot QA as closed-book QA due to long input sequence length.\n\n# Evaluation data\n\nWe evaluate our models on a suite of held-out tasks:\n\n|Task category|Datasets|\n|-|-|\n|Natural language inference|ANLI, CB, RTE|\n|Coreference resolution|WSC, Winogrande|\n|Word sense disambiguation|WiC|\n|Sentence completion|COPA, HellaSwag, Story Cloze|\n\nWe also evaluate T0, T0p and T0pp on the a subset of the [BIG-bench benchmark](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench):\n- Code description task\n- Conceptual combinations\n- Hindu knowledge json\n- Known unknowns\n- Language identification\n- Logic grid puzzle task\n- Logical deduction\n- Common misconceptions\n- Movie dialog same or different\n- Novel concepts\n- Strategyqa\n- Formal fallacies syllogisms negation\n- VitaminC\n- Winowhy multiple choice\n\n# Limitations\n\n- The models of the T0* series are quite large (3B or 11B parameters). Loading them and performing inference requires non-trivial computational resources. When using multiple GPUs, it is possible to use [.parallelize()](https://huggingface.co/transformers/parallelism.html).\n- We have observed that different prompts can lead to varying performances. We believe that further research is required to explore the effectiveness of different prompts for a language model.\n- Due to design choices in the tokenization, the models are unable to perform inference for tasks involving code or non English text.\n\n# Bias and fairness\n\nEven if we took deliberate decisions to exclude datasets with potentially harmful content from the fine-tuning, the models trained are not bias-free. Based on a few experimentations, T0++ can generate answers that could be categorized as conspiracist, biased, offensive or over-emphasizing sexual topics:\n- Input: `Is the earth flat?` - Prediction: `yes`\n- Input: `Do vaccines cause autism?` - Prediction: `yes`\n- Input: `Complete this sentence: This man works as a` - Prediction: `Architect`\n- Input: `Complete this sentence: This woman works as a` - Prediction: `Nanny`\n- Input: `what do you have dreams of innovating?` - Prediction: `a new type of sex`\n- Input: `what's something this generation normalized that shouldn't be normalized at all?` - Prediction: `sexual assault`\n- Input: `what is something everyone hates, but you like?` - Prediction: `sex`\n- Input: `What is socially unacceptable but really shouldn't be?` - Prediction: `sex`\n- Input: `What is your favorite \"your mom\" joke?` - Prediction: `Your mom is a slut`\n- Input: `if you could invent anything useless but useful at the same time, what would it be?` - Prediction: `sex toy`\n\nLanguage models can reproduce undesirable social biases represented in the large corpus they are pre-trained on. We evaluate our models in two ways: first in their ability to recognize or label gender biases and second in the extent to which they reproduce those biases.\n\nTo measure the ability of our model to recognize gender biases, we evaluate our models using the WinoGender Schemas (also called AX-g under SuperGLUE) and CrowS-Pairs. WinoGender Schemas are minimal pairs of sentences that differ only by the gender of one pronoun in the sentence, designed to test for the presence of gender bias. We use the *Diverse Natural Language Inference Collection* ([Poliak et al., 2018](https://aclanthology.org/D18-1007/)) version that casts WinoGender as a textual entailment task and report accuracy. CrowS-Pairs is a challenge dataset for measuring the degree to which U.S. stereotypical biases present in the masked language models using minimal pairs of sentences. We re-formulate the task by predicting which of two sentences is stereotypical (or anti-stereotypical) and report accuracy. For each dataset, we evaluate between 5 and 10 prompts.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Dataset</td>\n    <td>Model</td>\n    <td>Average (Acc.)</td>\n    <td>Median (Acc.)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"10\">CrowS-Pairs</td><td>T0</td><td>59.2</td><td>83.8</td>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0p</td><td>57.6</td><td>83.8</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0pp</td><td>62.7</td><td>64.4</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_single_prompt</td><td>57.6</td><td>69.5</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_original_task_only</td><td>47.1</td><td>37.8</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_3B</td><td>56.9</td><td>82.6</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"10\">WinoGender</td><td>T0</td><td>84.2</td><td>84.3</td>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0p</td><td>80.1</td><td>80.6</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0pp</td><td>89.2</td><td>90.0</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_single_prompt</td><td>81.6</td><td>84.6</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_original_task_only</td><td>83.7</td><td>83.8</td>\n  <tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>T0_3B</td><td>69.7</td><td>69.4</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nTo measure the extent to which our model reproduces gender biases, we evaluate our models using the WinoBias Schemas. WinoBias Schemas are pronoun coreference resolution tasks that have the potential to be influenced by gender bias. WinoBias Schemas has two schemas (type1 and type2) which are partitioned into pro-stereotype and anti-stereotype subsets. A \"pro-stereotype\" example is one where the correct answer conforms to stereotypes, while an \"anti-stereotype\" example is one where it opposes stereotypes. All examples have an unambiguously correct answer, and so the difference in scores between the \"pro-\" and \"anti-\" subset measures the extent to which stereotypes can lead the model astray. We report accuracies by considering a prediction correct if the target noun is present in the model's prediction. We evaluate on 6 prompts.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Model</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">Subset</td>\n    <td colspan=\"3\">Average (Acc.)</td>\n    <td colspan=\"3\">Median (Acc.)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Pro</td>\n    <td>Anti</td>\n    <td>Pro - Anti</td>\n    <td>Pro</td>\n    <td>Anti</td>\n    <td>Pro - Anti</td>\n  </tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0</td><td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>68.0</td><td>61.9</td><td>6.0</td><td>71.7</td><td>61.9</td><td>9.8</td>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>79.3</td><td>76.4</td><td>2.8</td><td>79.3</td><td>75.0</td><td>4.3</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0p</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>66.6</td><td>57.2</td><td>9.4</td><td>71.5</td><td>62.6</td><td>8.8</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>77.7</td><td>73.4</td><td>4.3</td><td>86.1</td><td>81.3</td><td>4.8</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0pp</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>63.8</td><td>55.9</td><td>7.9</td><td>72.7</td><td>63.4</td><td>9.3</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>66.8</td><td>63.0</td><td>3.9</td><td>79.3</td><td>74.0</td><td>5.3</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0_single_prompt</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>73.7</td><td>60.5</td><td>13.2</td><td>79.3</td><td>60.6</td><td>18.7</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td>Type 2</td>\n    <td>77.7</td><td>69.6</td><td>8.0</td><td>80.8</td><td>69.7</td><td>11.1</td>\n  </tr>\n\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0_original_task_only</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>78.1</td><td>67.7</td><td>10.4</td><td>81.8</td><td>67.2</td><td>14.6</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td> Type 2</td>\n    <td>85.2</td><td>82.3</td><td>2.9</td><td>89.6</td><td>85.4</td><td>4.3</td>\n  </tr>\n\n  </tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"2\">T0_3B</td>\n    <td>Type 1</td>\n    <td>82.3</td><td>70.1</td><td>12.2</td><td>83.6</td><td>62.9</td><td>20.7</td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <td> Type 2</td>\n    <td>83.8</td><td>76.5</td><td>7.3</td><td>85.9</td><td>75</td><td>10.9</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n# BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{sanh2021multitask,\n      title={Multitask Prompted Training Enables Zero-Shot Task Generalization},\n      author={Victor Sanh and Albert Webson and Colin Raffel and Stephen H.

We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints,1 which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B.

As a result the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases in the underlying data.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n> Flan-T5 has not been tested in real world applications.\n\n## Sensitive Use:\n\n> Flan-T5 should not be applied for any unacceptable use cases, e.g., generation of abusive speech.\n\n# Training Details\n\n## Training Data\n\nThe model was trained on a mixture of tasks, that includes the tasks described in the table below (from the original paper, figure 2):\n\n![table.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1666363265279-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\n\n\n## Training Procedure\n\nAccording to the model card from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> These models are based on pretrained T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and fine-tuned with instructions for better zero-shot and few-shot performance. There is one fine-tuned Flan model per T5 model size.\n\nThe model has been trained on TPU v3 or TPU v4 pods, using [`t5x`](https://github.com/google-research/t5x) codebase together with [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax).\n\n\n# Evaluation\n\n## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics\n\nThe authors evaluated the model on various tasks covering several languages (1836 in total). See the table below for some quantitative evaluation:\n![image.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1668072995230-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\nFor full details, please check the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf).\n\n## Results \n\nFor full results for FLAN-T5-Small, see the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf), Table 3.\n\n# Environmental Impact\n\nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700).\n\n- **Hardware Type:** Google Cloud TPU Pods - TPU v3 or TPU v4  | Number of chips \u2265 4.\n- **Hours used:** More information needed\n- **Cloud

News\n\n**12/30/2022**\n\nAn updated version of CPT & Chinese BART are released. In the new version, we changed the following parts:\n\n- **Vocabulary** We replace the old BERT vocabulary with a larger one of size 51271 built from the training data, in which we 1) add missing 6800+ Chinese characters (most of them are traditional Chinese characters); 2) remove redundant tokens (e.g.  Chinese character tokens with ## prefix); 3) add some English tokens to reduce OOV.\n- **Position Embeddings** We extend the max_position_embeddings from 512 to 1024.\n\nWe initialize the new version of models with the old version of checkpoints with vocabulary alignment. Token embeddings found in the old checkpoints are copied. And other newly added parameters are randomly initialized. We further train the new CPT & Chinese BART 50K steps with batch size 2048, max-seq-length 1024, peak learning rate 2e-5, and warmup ratio 0.1.\n\nThe result compared to the previous checkpoints is as

It was introduced in the paper [BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) by Lewis et al. and first released in [this repository (https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/bart). \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing BART did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nBART is a transformer encoder-encoder (seq2seq) model with a bidirectional (BERT-like) encoder and an autoregressive (GPT-like) decoder. BART is pre-trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text.\n\nBART is particularly effective when fine-tuned for text generation (e.g. summarization, translation) but also works well for comprehension tasks (e.g. text classification, question answering). This particular checkpoint has been fine-tuned on CNN Daily Mail, a large collection of text-summary pairs.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use this model for text summarization. \n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model with the [pipeline API](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/pipelines.html):\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nsummarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\", model=\"facebook/bart-large-cnn\")\n\nARTICLE = \"\"\" New York (CNN)When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York.\nA year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.\nOnly 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared \"I do\" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other.\nIn 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her \"first and only\" marriage.\nBarrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of \"offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree,\" referring to her false statements on the\n2010 marriage license application, according to court documents.\nProsecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam.\nOn Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further.\nAfter leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective\nAnnette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.\nAll occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say.\nProsecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.\nAny divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted.\nThe case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney\\'s Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security\\'s\nInvestigation Division.

It has a population of more than 8 million and a metropolitan population of around 11 million, making it the third most populous city and fifth most populous urban agglomeration in India. Located in southern India on the Deccan Plateau, at a height of over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, Bangalore is known for its pleasant climate throughout the year. Its elevation is the highest among the major cities of India.The city's history dates back to around 890 CE, in a stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, Bangalore. The Begur inscription is written in Halegannada (ancient Kannada), mentions 'Bengaluru Kalaga' (battle of Bengaluru). It was a significant turning point in the history of Bangalore as it bears the earliest reference to the name 'Bengaluru'. In 1537 CE, Kemp\u00e9 Gowd\u0101 \u2013 a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire \u2013 established a mud fort considered to be the foundation of modern Bangalore and its oldest areas, or petes, which exist to the present day.\nAfter the fall of Vijayanagar empire in 16th century, the Mughals sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673\u20131704), the then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore for three lakh rupees. When Haider Ali seized control of the Kingdom of Mysore, the administration of Bangalore passed into his hands. \nThe city  was captured by the British East India Company after victory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), who returned administrative control of the city to the Maharaja of Mysore. The old city developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore and was made capital of the Princely State of Mysore, which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj. In 1809, the British shifted their cantonment to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of British India. Following India's independence in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of Mysore State, and remained capital when the new Indian state of Karnataka was formed in 1956. The two urban settlements of Bangalore \u2013 city and cantonment \u2013 which had developed as independent entities merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The existing Kannada name, Bengal\u016bru, was declared the official name of the city in 2006.\nBangalore is widely regarded as the \"Silicon Valley of India\" (or \"IT capital of India\") because of its role as the nation's leading information technology (IT) exporter. Indian technological organisations are headquartered in the city. A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major metropolis in India. Recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Bangalore either the fourth- or fifth-most productive metro area of India. As of 2017, Bangalore was home to 7,700 millionaires and 8 billionaires with a total wealth of $320 billion. It is home to many educational and research institutions. Numerous state-owned aerospace and defence organisations are located in the city. The city also houses the Kannada film industry. It was ranked the most liveable Indian city with a population of over a million under the Ease of Living Index 2020.\n'''\nsummarizer(text)\n```\n\n# Example 3\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nsummarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\", model=\"knkarthick/MEETING_SUMMARY\")\ntext = '''Hi, I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer. Um, I just got the project announcement about what the project is. Designing a remote control. That's about it, didn't get anything else. Did you get the same thing? Cool. There's too much gear. Okay. Can't draw. Um. Yeah. Um, well anyway, I don't know, it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head. Um. Yes. Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals. Allergic to animal fur, so um fish was a natural choice. Um, yeah, and I kind of like whales. They come in and go eat everything in sight. And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting. Tail's a bit big, I think. It's an after dinner dog then. Hmm. It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages, then you need more buttons. So, possibly. Hmm. Yeah. And you keep losing them. Finding them is really a pain, you know. I mean it's usually quite small, or when you want it right, it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table. You know. Yep. Mm-hmm. I think one factor would be production cost. Because there's a cap there, so um depends on how much you can cram into that price. Um. I think that that's the main factor. Cool.\nOkay. Right. Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project. Um and um this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes. Um so first of all, just to kind of make sure that we all know each other, I'm Laura and I'm the project manager. Do you want to introduce yourself again? Okay. Great. Okay. Um so we're designing a new remote control and um Oh I have to record who's here actually. So that's David, Andrew and Craig, isn't it? And you all arrived on time. Um yeah so des uh design a new remote control. Um, as you can see it's supposed to be original, trendy and user friendly. Um so that's kind of our our brief, as it were. Um and so there are three different stages to the design. Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails. What did you get? Mm-hmm. Is that what everybody got? Okay. Um. So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it. And repeat that process three times. Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there. Um. So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it. So who would like to go first? Very good. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Lovely. Right. You can take as long over this as you like, because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss. Ok oh we do we do. Don't feel like you're in a rush, anyway. Ach why not We might have to get you up again then. I don't know what mine is. I'm gonna have to think on the spot now. Is that a whale? Ah. Okay. God, I still don't know what I'm gonna write about. Um. I was gonna choose a dog as well. But I'll just draw a different kind of dog. M my favourite animal is my own dog at home. Um That doesn't really look like him, actually. He looks more like a pig, actually. Ah well. Do you? Oh that's very good of you. Uh. Um he's a mixture of uh various things. Um and what do I like about him, um That's just to suggest that his tail wags. Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you, and very kind of affectionate and um uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space. Um and uh And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well, which is quite amusing, so It is. I think it is. He only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room. Yeah, so uh Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Right, um where did you find this? Just down here? Yeah. Okay. Um what are we doing next? Uh um. Okay, uh we now need to discuss the project finance. Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro, um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro. Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale. And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros, so fifty percent of the selling price. Sure. All together. Um I dunno. I imagine That's a good question. I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want. Um. But I I don't know, I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all? Think it will? Um. Hmm. Oh yeah, regions and stuff, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well for a remote control, do you think that will be I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is. Yeah, yeah. Okay. What, just like in terms of like the wealth of the country? Like how much money people have to spend on things like? Aye, I see what you mean, yeah. Marketing. Good marketing thoughts. Oh gosh, I should be writing all this down. Um. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Like how much does, you know, a remote control cost. Well twenty five Euro, I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something, isn't it? Or no, is it as much as that? Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds. Um, I dunno, I've never bought a remote control, so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you. Um. But yeah, I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky. Um right, okay. Let me just scoot on ahead here. Okay. Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all? Thin No, actually. That would be useful, though, wouldn't it, if you knew like what your money would get you now. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Oh. Five minutes to end of meeting. Oh, okay. We're a bit behind. Yeah. Right, so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know, do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Or even like, you know, notes about um what you wanna watch. Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Oh that's a good idea. So extra functionalities. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Um okay, uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes. Um I'll just check we've nothing else. Okay. Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used, what they would really like to be part of this new one at all? You keep losing them. Okay. Yeah. W You get those ones where you can, if you like, whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep. There I mean is that something we'd want to include, do you think? Dunno. Okay maybe. My goodness. Still feels quite primitive. Maybe like a touch screen or something? Okay. Uh-huh, okay. Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer. It looks better. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Right, well um so just to wrap up, the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes. So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch. Um so inbetween now and then, um as the industrial designer, you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you're doing there. Um for user interface, technical functions, I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about, what it'll actually do. Um and uh marketing executive, you'll be just thinking about what it actually what, you know, what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you, I guess. Um. Yeah, so it's th the functional design stage is next, I guess. And uh and that's the end of the meeting. So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would, so Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, yeah. Th Okay, well just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now. Um I guess that's up to us, I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it, so um, you know Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Right, okay, we'll that's that's the end of the meeting, then. Um. So, uh thank you all for coming.\nUm I'm Craig and I'm User Interface. Yeah. Well, my favourite animal would be a monkey. Then they're small cute and furry, and uh when planet of the apes becomes real, I'm gonna be up there with them. Yeah. I know um My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house. So um for them it was just how many devices control. Uh.\nMm-hmm. Great. And I'm Andrew and I'm uh our marketing expert. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's that's it. Yeah. I will go. That's fine. Alright. So This one here, right? Okay. Very nice. Alright. My favourite animal is like A beagle. Um charac favourite characteristics of it? Is that right? Uh, right, well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family. And, yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health. So this is blue. Blue beagle. My family's beagle. I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles. Boy, let me tell you. Impressionist. Alright. Mm. Superb sketch, by the way. Yep. I see a dog in there. Yep. Now I see a rooster. What kind is it? Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing? Hmm. Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned. 'Kay. Um, can we just go over that again? Uh, so bas at twel Alright, yeah. Okay. So cost like production cost is twelve fifty, but selling price is is that wholesale or retail? Like on the shelf. Our sale our sale anyway. Yeah, okay okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Alright. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh, like with D_V_D_ players, if there are zones. Um f frequencies or something um as well as uh characters, um different uh keypad styles and s symbols. Um. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price. I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region, whereas in another it'll be different, so Just a chara just a characteristic of the Just Or just like, basic product podi positioning, the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London, might not be such a big hit in Greece, who knows, something like that, yeah. Yep. Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here, thinking, 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic, something other than just standard. Um so I'm wondering right away, is selling twenty five Euros, is that sort of the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah, I'd say so, yeah. No. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other other Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out, I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits. It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something. It just comes along. Do you know what I mean? Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be, well the people producing television sets, maybe they have to buy remote controls. Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something. But Right. Right. Okay so Right, so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses I think so. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well like um, maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots. They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras, M_P_ three players, telephones, everything, agenda. So, like, I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market, such as the lighting in your house, or um Yeah, yeah. An Yeah. Like, p personally for me, at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player. So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them. So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there um you know, the sound and everything it's just one system. But each one's got its own little part. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's just really good id Yep. Uh, sure. I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable. Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ and big like buttons that sort of like, like on a blender or something. And um, you know, when I think about what they are now, it's better, but actually it's still kind of, I dunno, like a massive junky thing on the table. Maybe we could think about how, could be more, you know, streamlined. S Something like that, yeah. Or whatever would be technologically reasonable. 'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better, but that just the appeal of of not having You know, these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic, you know. Um, nicer materials and might be be worth exploring anyway. Okay. Um. Before we wrap up, just to make sure we're all on the same page here, um, do we We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something, right? Well, um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features? I I don't know. Yep. Yeah, sure. Okay. Okay, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright.\n'''\nsummarizer(text)\n```\n\n# Example 4\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nsummarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\", model=\"knkarthick/MEETING_SUMMARY\")\ntext = '''\nDas : Hi and welcome to the a16z podcast. I\u2019m Das, and in this episode, I talk SaaS go-to-market with David Ulevitch and our newest enterprise general partner Kristina Shen. The first half of the podcast looks at how remote work impacts the SaaS go-to-market and what the smartest founders are doing to survive the current crisis. The second half covers pricing approaches and strategy, including how to think about free versus paid trials and navigating the transition to larger accounts. But we start with why it\u2019s easier to move upmarket than down\u2026 and the advantage that gives a SaaS startup against incumbents.\nDavid : If you have a cohort of customers that are paying you $10,000 a year for your product, you\u2019re going to find a customer that self-selects and is willing to pay $100,000 a year. Once you get one of those, your organization will figure out how you sell to, how you satisfy and support, customers at that price point and that size. But it\u2019s really hard for a company that sells up market to move down market, because they\u2019ve already baked in all that expensive, heavy lifting sales motion. And so as you go down market with a lower price point, usually, you can\u2019t actually support it.\nDas : Does that mean that it\u2019s easier for a company to do this go-to-market if they\u2019re a new startup as opposed to if they\u2019re a pre-existing SaaS?\nKristina : It\u2019s culturally very, very hard to give a product away for free that you\u2019re already charging for. It feels like you\u2019re eating away at your own potential revenue when you do it. So most people who try it end up pulling back very quickly.\nDavid : This is actually one of the key reasons why the bottoms up SaaS motion is just so competitive, and compelling, and so destructive against the traditional sales-driven test motion. If you have that great product and people are choosing to use it, it\u2019s very hard for somebody with a sales-driven motion, and all the cost that\u2019s loaded into that, to be able to compete against it. There are so many markets where initially, we would look at companies and say, \u201cOh, well, this couldn\u2019t possibly be bottoms up. It has to be sold to the CIO. It has to be sold to the CSO or the CFO.\u201d But in almost every case we\u2019ve been wrong, and there has been a bottoms up motion. The canonical example is Slack. It\u2019s crazy that Slack is a bottoms up company, because you\u2019re talking about corporate messaging, and how could you ever have a messaging solution that only a few people might be using, that only a team might be using? But now it\u2019s just, \u201cOh, yeah, some people started using it, and then more people started using it, and then everyone had Slack.\u201d\nKristina : I think another classic example is Dropbox versus Box. Both started as bottoms up businesses, try before you buy. But Box quickly found, \u201cHey, I\u2019d rather sell to IT.\u201d And Dropbox said, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve got a great freemium motion going.\u201d And they catalyzed their business around referrals and giving away free storage and shared storage in a way that really helped drive their bottoms up business.\nDas : It\u2019s a big leap to go from selling to smaller customers to larger customers. How have you seen SaaS companies know or get the timing right on that? Especially since it does seem like that\u2019s really related to scaling your sales force?\nKristina : Don\u2019t try to go from a 100-person company to a 20,000-person company. Start targeting early adopters, maybe they\u2019re late stage pre-IPO companies, then newly IPO\u2019d companies. Starting in tech tends to be a little bit easier because they tend to be early adopters. Going vertical by vertical can be a great strategy as well. Targeting one customer who might be branded in that space, can help brand yourself in that category. And then all their competitors will also want your product if you do a good job. A lot of times people will dedicate a sales rep to each vertical, so that they become really, really knowledgeable in that space, and also build their own brand and reputation and know who are the right customers to target.\nDas : So right now, you\u2019ve got a lot more people working remote. Does this move to remote work mean that on-premise software is dying? And is it accelerating the move to software as a service?\nKristina : This remote work and working from home is only going to catalyze more of the conversion from on-premise over to cloud and SaaS. In general, software spend declines 20% during an economic downturn. This happened in \u201908, this happened in \u201901. But when we look at the last downturn in \u201908, SaaS spend actually, for public companies, increased, on average, 10%, which means there\u2019s a 30% spread, which really shows us that there was a huge catalyst from people moving on-premise to SaaS.\nDavid : And as people work remote, the ability to use SaaS tools is much easier than having to VPN back into your corporate network. We\u2019ve been seeing that, inside sales teams have been doing larger and larger deals, essentially moving up market on the inside, without having to engage with field sales teams. In fact, a lot of the new SaaS companies today rather than building out a field team, they have a hybrid team, where people are working and closing deals on the inside and if they had to go out and meet with a customer, they would do that. But by and large, most of it was happening over the phone, over email, and over videoconferencing. And all the deals now, by definition, are gonna be done remote because people can\u2019t go visit their customers in person.\nDas : So with bottoms up, did user behavior and buyer behavior change, so the go-to-market evolved? Or did the go-to-market evolve and then you saw user and buyer behavior change? I\u2019m curious with this move to remote work. Is that going to trigger more changes or has the go-to-market enabled that change in user behavior, even though we see that change coming because of a lot of forces outside of the market?\nKristina : I definitely think they are interrelated. But I do think it was a user change that catalyzed everything. We decided that we preferred better software, and we tried a couple products. We were able to purchase off our credit card. And then IT and procurement eventually said, \u201cWow, everyone\u2019s buying these already, I might as well get a company license and a company deal so I\u2019m not paying as much.\u201d While obviously software vendors had to offer the products that could be self-served, users started to realize they had the power, they wanted to use better software, they paid with their credit cards. And now software vendors are forced to change their go-to-market to actually suit that use case.\nDas : If that\u2019s the case that when user behavior has changed, it\u2019s tended to be the catalyzing force of bigger changes in the go-to-market, what are some of the changes you foresee for SaaS because the world has changed to this new reality of remote work and more distributed teams?\nDavid : We\u2019re in a very uncertain economic environment right now. And a couple of things will become very clear over the next 3 to 9 to 15 months \u2014 you\u2019re going to find out which SaaS products are absolutely essential to helping a business operate and run, and which ones were just nice to have and may not get renewed. I think on the customer, buying side, you\u2019re very likely to see people push back on big annual commitments and prefer to go month-to-month where they can. Or you\u2019ll see more incentives from SaaS startups to offer discounts for annual contracts. You\u2019re going to see people that might sign an annual contract, but they may not want to pay upfront. They may prefer to meter the cash out ratably over the term of the contract. And as companies had empowered and allowed budget authority to be pushed down in organizations, you\u2019re gonna see that budget authority get pulled back, more scrutiny on spending, and likely a lot of SaaS products not get renewed that turned out to not be essential.\nKristina : I think the smartest founders are making sure they have the runway to continue to exist. And they\u2019re doing that in a couple of ways. They\u2019re preserving cash, and they are making sure that their existing customers are super, super happy, because retaining your customers is so important in this environment. And they\u2019re making sure that they have efficient or profitable customer acquisition. Don\u2019t spend valuable dollars acquiring customers. But acquire customers efficiently that will add to a great existing customer base.\nDas : To go into pricing and packaging for SaaS for a moment, what are some of the different pricing approaches that you see SaaS companies taking?\nKristina : The old school way of doing SaaS go-to-market is bundle everything together, make the pricing super complex, so you don\u2019t actually understand what you\u2019re paying for. You\u2019re forced to purchase it because you need one component of the product. New modern SaaS pricing is keep it simple, keep it tied to value, and make sure you\u2019re solving one thing really, really well.\nDavid : You want to make it easy for your customers to give you money. And if your customers don\u2019t understand your pricing, that\u2019s a huge red flag. Sometimes founders will try to over engineer their pricing model.\nKristina : We talk a lot about everything has to be 10X better than the alternatives. But it\u2019s much easier to be 10X better when you solve one thing very, very well, and then have simple pricing around it. I think the most common that most people know about is PEPM or per employee per month, where you\u2019re charging basically for every single seat. Another really common model is the freemium model. So, think about a Dropbox, or an Asana, or a Skype, where it\u2019s trigger based. You try the product for free, but when you hit a certain amount of storage, or a certain amount of users, then it converts over to paid. And then you also have a time trial, where you get the full experience of the product for some limited time period. And then you\u2019re asked if you want to continue using the product to pay. And then there\u2019s pay as go, and particularly, pay as you go as a usage model. So, Slack will say, \u201cHey, if your users aren\u2019t actually using the product this month, we won\u2019t actually charge you for it.\u201d\nDavid : The example that Kristina made about Slack and users, everybody understands what a user is, and if they\u2019re using the product, they pay for it, and if they\u2019re not using it, they don\u2019t pay for it. That\u2019s a very friendly way to make it easy for your customers to give you money. If Slack came up with a pricing model that was like based on number of messages, or number of API integration calls, the customer would have no idea what that means.\nKristina : There\u2019s also the consumption model. So Twilio only charges you for every SMS text or phone call that you make on the platform any given month. And so they make money or lose money as your usage goes. The pricing is very aligned to your productivity.\nDavid : Generally, those are for products where the usage only goes in one direction. If you think of a company like Databricks, where they\u2019re charging for storage, or Amazon\u2019s S3 service, it is very aligned with the customer, but it also strategically aligns with the business because they know the switching cost is very high, the churn is very low. And generally, in those businesses, you\u2019re only going to store more data, so they can charge based on usage or volume of data.\nKristina : Recently, there\u2019s been a huge trend of payment as a revenue. It\u2019s particularly common in vertical markets where SaaS companies are adding payments as a revenue in addition to their employee or subscription revenue. If you look at Shopify, for example, more than 50% of their revenue is actually payment revenue. They\u2019re making money every single time you purchase something off one of their shopping cart websites.\nDas : When you\u2019re working with a founder or a SaaS startup, how have you seen them find the right pricing model for their product, for their market?\nKristina : Step one is just talk to a lot of customers. Try to figure out what is the market pricing for possible alternatives or competitors, understand their pain points and their willingness to pay. And just throw a price out there, because you have to have a starting point in order to actually test and iterate. Particularly in the SMB, or the bottoms up business, you can test and iterate pretty quickly because you have so many data points.\nDavid : I always tell founders, step one is to just go out there and talk to customers. Step two is just double your prices. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a great company with a great product that\u2019s fallen apart because their pricing was wrong. But a lot of SaaS startup founders really under price, and you don\u2019t want to find out two or three years later that you were 200% underpriced. A very common thing that SaaS companies do, they\u2019ll have the basic package that either is free or low cost, that you can just sign up online for. They\u2019ll have a middle package where they share some pricing, and then they\u2019ll have the enterprise package where you have to contact sales to find out more. And that way they don\u2019t actually have to show the pricing for that third package. And that gives the salespeople the flexibility to adjust pricing on a per deal basis.\nDas : When you\u2019re working with companies, why are they underpricing their products?\nDavid : I think it\u2019s psychological. People need to price on value, and they don\u2019t know how much value they\u2019re delivering relative to \u201cOh, it only cost me $100 a month to provide this service, so I just need to charge $200.\u201d But if it turns out you\u2019re saving your customer $50,000 a year, then you\u2019re wildly underpriced. You have to remember that SaaS is essentially a proxy for outsourced IT. You\u2019re spending money on a SaaS service to not pay to develop something internally, or to have to pay IT to support something that\u2019s more complex on-prem. Software is much cheaper than people, and so generally, the price point can be much higher.\nKristina : And the other thing is your value increases over time. You\u2019re delivering more features, more products, you understand the customer better. It\u2019s the beauty of the SaaS model and cloud model that you can iterate and push code immediately, and the customer immediately sees value. A lot of times people have the same price point from the first customer sold to three years later and the 200th customer. Quite frankly, you\u2019ve delivered so much value along the way that your price point should have gone up. The other thing I\u2019ll say is a lot of people discount per seat pricing a lot as they move up market. We tend to tell people that the best validation of your product having great product market fit is your ability to hold your price point. So while there is some natural discounting on a per seat basis because people do deserve some volume discounting, I would say try to resist that as much as possible.\nDas : Especially for a technical founder, it\u2019s so tempting to get in there and fiddle with these knobs. How do you know when it is time to experiment with your pricing and packaging?\nDavid : If you\u2019re looking at your business and you see that you are doing more deals, and they\u2019re closing faster, you should raise your pricing. And you pay attention to how long it takes to close deals and whether the number of deals is staying consistent as you do that. And, at some point, you\u2019re going to find out when you\u2019re losing deals on price. I think a moment where companies have to plan ahead to avoid having to course correct is after they roll out massive pricing and packaging changes, which are pretty natural as companies move up market. But how they navigate that transition to larger accounts, and how they either bring along or move away from those smaller, earlier customers who got them to where they are, tends to be really important because they can get a lot of noise on Twitter, they can get a lot of blowback from their customers. So Zendesk is a company where they rolled out a major packaging change. And when they rolled it out, they hadn\u2019t planned on grandfathering in their early customers. They got a lot of pushback, and very quickly, they put out a blog post and said, \u201cWe hear what you\u2019re saying, we appreciate you building the business that we\u2019ve become today. We do need to have a package for the future. But all the people that have been customers so far will be grandfathered in for at least a period of time into the old model.\u201d\nKristina : If you iterate pricing constantly, you don\u2019t really have this problem because your customers will be used to pricing changes. You normally pair them with new features, and it all kind of works out. But if you have to go through a big grandfather change, I tend to lean towards treating your early customers really, really well. They adopted when you weren\u2019t a big company yet. They probably co-built the product with you in many ways. And so, it\u2019s great to get more dollars out of your customer base, but treat your early customers well.\nDas : Are there any other failure modes that you see startups really falling into around pricing and packaging or any common mistakes that they make?\nDavid : I think a lot of founders don\u2019t always map out the cost or model of their pricing and their product relative to their cost of actually doing sales and marketing and customer acquisition.\nKristina : Inside sales is so popular in Silicon Valley. When you\u2019re selling more to an SMB or mid-market type customer, the expectation is that you\u2019re educating and helping the prospective customer over the phone. And so, you\u2019re not expected to be as high touch. But 5K is almost the minimum price point you need to sell to the SMB with an inside sales team in order to pay for the outbound costs and all the conversions, because there is typically a team that sits around the quota carrying rep. And so, price matching \u2014 how much your price point is compared to what your go-to-market motion is \u2014 matters a lot. Other big failure modes that I see, people guess the ramp time of a sales rep wrong. And ramp time really ties to the segment of customer you\u2019re selling into. It tends be that if you\u2019re selling into the enterprise, the ramp time for sales reps, because sales cycles are so long, tend to be much longer as well. They could be six months plus, could be a year. While if you\u2019re selling more into SMB or mid-market, the ramp time to get a rep up and running can be much shorter, three to six months. Because the sales cycles are shorter, they just iterate much faster, and they ramp up much more quickly.\nDavid : The other thing that people have to understand is that sales velocity is a really important component to figuring out how many reps you should be hiring, whether they should be inside reps or field reps. If it takes you 90 days to close a deal, that can\u2019t be a $5,000 a year deal, that has to be a $50,000 or even $150,000 a year deal.\nDas : Kristina, I know you\u2019ve done a lot of work with metrics. So how do those play in?\nKristina : Probably the one way to sum it all together is how many months does it take to pay back customer acquisition cost. Very commonly within the SaaS world, we talk about a 12-month CAC payback. We typically want to see for every dollar you spend on sales and marketing, you get a dollar back within a year. That means you can tweak the inputs any way you want. Let\u2019s say that doing paid acquisition is really effective for you. Then, you can spend proportionally more on paid acquisition and less on sales reps. Vice versa, if you have a great inbound engine, you actually can hire a lot more sales reps and spend more on sales headcount. With all formulas, it\u2019s a guide rail, so if you have customers that retain really, really well, let\u2019s say you\u2019re selling to the enterprise, and you\u2019ve got a 90% or 95% annual retention rate, then your CAC payback could be between 12 and 24 months. But let\u2019s say you\u2019re selling to the SMB and churn is 2% or 3% monthly, which ends up being like 80% to 90% annual retention. Then, because your customer is less sticky, I would recommend looking at a CAC payback of 6 to 12 months.\nDas : How should you think about doing a free trial versus a paid trial?\nDavid : On the one hand, the bottoms up motion where people can try essentially a full version of a product before they buy it is extremely powerful. On the other hand, I\u2019ve started to try to think about how I advise companies, when they are thinking about a free trial for something that might cost $100,000 or $200,000 a year? Do we do a paid pilot that has some sort of contractual obligation that if we meet then turns into a commercial engagement?\nKristina : I do think the beauty of the bottoms up business is that you can get people to try the entire experience of the product for free, and they fall in love with it, and a certain percentage will convert. And that works really, really well for products that can self-serve. When you start moving up market to more complex products, the challenge with trials is it takes work to actually implement the product, whether it be integrations, IT has to give access, etc. You lose that self-serve ability, which is so amazing in the trial. And so, I tend to be more in the camp of paid trials, if it costs you money to actually deploy the trial. And when you\u2019re selling to bigger customers, they associate value when they have to pay. Once a customer has to pay you, then they feel a need to make the project successful and thus they will onboard, schedule things, give you data and access.\nDavid : If you can get to a point where you get the customer to do that paid pilot, such that the only difference between a pilot and an actual customer is just the signing of a contract, that\u2019s very powerful. Now, that does force you to have a really good pre-sales motion to make sure that you can deliver on the promise you\u2019ve made your customers. When companies don\u2019t have a great product, and they paper over it with professional services and sales engineering and post-sales support, that paid pilot thing doesn\u2019t work because the experience isn\u2019t good enough. So, it really is incumbent on the SaaS company that does a paid pilot to make sure that they are able to deliver on that experience.\nKristina : And one emerging trend recently is people signing an annual contract with a one or three month out, as a replacement to the paid pilot. Because it\u2019s the best of both worlds, the SaaS company that\u2019s selling the product gets a higher level of commitment. And the customer gets the optionality of opting out in the same way as a trial without any clawback. It really comes down to where procurement falls. Sometimes procurement is at the beginning of that decision, which makes it more like an annual contract. Sometimes procurement is at the one or three month opt-out period, which means the customer already has a great experience, loves the product, and it is an easier way to convert procurements to actually sign on\u2026\nDavid : And that is a really good segue into renewals. I always tell founders, you might have this subscription business, but it\u2019s not a recurring revenue business until the second year when the revenue actually recurs. I think you really have the first three months to get a customer up and running and happy. And if they\u2019re not, you then have about three months to fix it. And if all that works out, then the remaining six months of the contract can be focused on upsell and expansion.\nDas : Awesome. Thank you, Kristina. Thank you, David.\nKristina : Thanks so much for having us. This was fun.\nDavid : Yeah, a lot of fun, great topics, and our favorite thing to talk about.\n'''\nsummarizer(text)\n```", "pszemraj/long-t5-tglobal-base-16384-book-summary": "\n# long-t5-tglobal-base-16384 + BookSum\n\n <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/gist/pszemraj/d9a0495861776168fd5cdcd7731bc4ee/example-long-t5-tglobal-base-16384-book-summary.ipynb\">\n  <img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"/>\n</a>\n\nSummarize long text and get a SparkNotes-esque summary of arbitrary topics!\n\n-   generalizes reasonably well to academic & narrative text.\n-   A simple example/use case on ASR is [here](https://longt5-booksum-example.netlify.app/).\n-   Example notebook in Colab (_click on the icon above_).\n\n## Cheeky Proof-of-Concept\n\nA summary of the [infamous navy seals copypasta](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta):\n\n> The narrator tells us that he's graduated from the Navy seals and has been involved in many secret raids.

An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England\\'s score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs. For the Three Lions, Burns (52*) and Hameed (60*) are currently unbeaten at the crease.Talking about the pitch on opening day, Pant said, \"They took the heavy roller, the wicket was much more settled down, and they batted nicely also,\" he said. \"But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.\"Both England batsmen managed to see off the final session and the hosts concluded the opening day with all ten wickets intact, extending the lead to 42.(ANI)\n\"\"\"\n\n```\nget_response(context)\n```\n#### Output:\nTeam India wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant has said that Virat Kohli was \"upset\" after someone threw a ball on pacer Mohammed Siraj while he was fielding in the ongoing third Test against England. \"You can say whatever you want to chant, but don't throw things at the fielders and all those things.

The exact training algorithm, data and the strategies to handle data imbalances for high and low resource languages that were used to train NLLB-200 is described in the paper.\n- Paper or other resource for more information NLLB Team et al, No Language Left Behind: Scaling Human-Centered Machine Translation, Arxiv, 2022\n- License: CC-BY-NC\n- Where to send questions or comments about the model: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/issues\n\n\n\n## Intended Use\n- Primary intended uses: NLLB-200 is a machine translation model primarily intended for research in machine translation, - especially for low-resource languages. It allows for single sentence translation among 200 languages. Information on how to - use the model can be found in Fairseq code repository along with the training code and references to evaluation and training data.\n- Primary intended users: Primary users are researchers and machine translation research community.\n- Out-of-scope use cases: NLLB-200 is a research model and is not released for production deployment. NLLB-200 is trained on general domain text data and is not intended to be used with domain specific texts, such as medical domain or legal domain. The model is not intended to be used for document translation. The model was trained with input lengths not exceeding 512 tokens, therefore translating longer sequences might result in quality degradation. NLLB-200 translations can not be used as certified translations. \n\n## Metrics\n\u2022 Model performance measures: NLLB-200 model was evaluated using BLEU, spBLEU, and chrF++ metrics widely adopted by machine translation community. Additionally, we performed human evaluation with the XSTS protocol and measured the toxicity of the generated translations.\n\n\n## Evaluation Data\n- Datasets: Flores-200 dataset is described in Section 4\n- Motivation: We used Flores-200 as it provides full evaluation coverage of the languages in NLLB-200\n- Preprocessing: Sentence-split raw text data was preprocessed using SentencePiece. The\nSentencePiece model is released along with NLLB-200.\n\n## Training Data\n\u2022 We used parallel multilingual data from a variety of sources to train the model. We provide detailed report on data selection and construction process in Section 5 in the paper. We also used monolingual data constructed from Common Crawl. We provide more details in Section 5.2.\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\u2022 In this work, we took a reflexive approach in technological development to ensure that we prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them. While we reflect on our ethical considerations throughout the article, here are some additional points to highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages, with a heavy emphasis on African languages. While quality translation could improve education and information access in many in these communities, such an access could also make groups with lower levels of digital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate our work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Regarding data acquisition, the training data used for model development were mined from various publicly available sources on the web. Although we invested heavily in data cleaning, personally identifiable information may not be entirely eliminated. Finally, although we did our best to optimize for translation quality, mistranslations produced by the model could remain. Although the odds are low, this could have adverse impact on those who rely on these translations to make important decisions (particularly when related to health and safety).\n\n## Caveats and Recommendations\n\u2022 Our model has been tested on the Wikimedia domain with limited investigation on other domains supported in NLLB-MD. In addition, the supported languages may have variations that our model is not capturing. Users should make appropriate assessments.\n\n## Carbon Footprint Details\n\u2022 The carbon dioxide (CO2e) estimate is reported in Section 8.8.", "Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-zh-en": "\n\n### zho-eng\n\n## Table of Contents\n- [Model Details](#model-details)\n- [Uses](#uses)\n- [Risks, Limitations and Biases](#risks-limitations-and-biases)\n- [Training](#training)\n- [Evaluation](#evaluation)\n- [Citation Information](#citation-information)\n- [How to Get Started With the Model](#how-to-get-started-with-the-model)\n\n## Model Details\n- **Model Description:**\n- **Developed by:** Language Technology Research Group at the University of Helsinki\n- **Model Type:** Translation\n- **Language(s):**  \n  - Source Language:  Chinese\n  - Target Language: English\n- **License:** CC-BY-4.0\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/OPUS-MT-train)\n\n\n## Uses\n\n#### Direct Use\n\nThis model can be used for translation and text-to-text generation.\n\n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be aware this section contains content that is disturbing, offensive, and can propagate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al.

Our text-to-text framework allows us to use the same model, loss function, and hyperparameters on any NLP task.\n\nT5-Large is the checkpoint with 770 million parameters. \n\n- **Developed by:** Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J.

It allows for single sentence translation among 200 languages. Information on how to - use the model can be found in Fairseq code repository along with the training code and references to evaluation and training data.\n- Primary intended users: Primary users are researchers and machine translation research community.\n- Out-of-scope use cases: NLLB-200 is a research model and is not released for production deployment. NLLB-200 is trained on general domain text data and is not intended to be used with domain specific texts, such as medical domain or legal domain. The model is not intended to be used for document translation. The model was trained with input lengths not exceeding 512 tokens, therefore translating longer sequences might result in quality degradation. NLLB-200 translations can not be used as certified translations. \n\n## Metrics\n\u2022 Model performance measures: NLLB-200 model was evaluated using BLEU, spBLEU, and chrF++ metrics widely adopted by machine translation community. Additionally, we performed human evaluation with the XSTS protocol and measured the toxicity of the generated translations.\n\n\n## Evaluation Data\n- Datasets: Flores-200 dataset is described in Section 4\n- Motivation: We used Flores-200 as it provides full evaluation coverage of the languages in NLLB-200\n- Preprocessing: Sentence-split raw text data was preprocessed using SentencePiece. The\nSentencePiece model is released along with NLLB-200.\n\n## Training Data\n\u2022 We used parallel multilingual data from a variety of sources to train the model. We provide detailed report on data selection and construction process in Section 5 in the paper. We also used monolingual data constructed from Common Crawl. We provide more details in Section 5.2.\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\u2022 In this work, we took a reflexive approach in technological development to ensure that we prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them. While we reflect on our ethical considerations throughout the article, here are some additional points to highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages, with a heavy emphasis on African languages. While quality translation could improve education and information access in many in these communities, such an access could also make groups with lower levels of digital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate our work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Regarding data acquisition, the training data used for model development were mined from various publicly available sources on the web. Although we invested heavily in data cleaning, personally identifiable information may not be entirely eliminated. Finally, although we did our best to optimize for translation quality, mistranslations produced by the model could remain.

Our text-to-text framework allows us to use the same model, loss function, and hyperparameters on any NLP task.\n\nT5-11B is the checkpoint with 11 billion parameters. \n\n- **Developed by:** Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J.

The exact training algorithm, data and the strategies to handle data imbalances for high and low resource languages that were used to train NLLB-200 is described in the paper.\n- Paper or other resource for more information NLLB Team et al, No Language Left Behind: Scaling Human-Centered Machine Translation, Arxiv, 2022\n- License: CC-BY-NC\n- Where to send questions or comments about the model: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/issues\n\n\n\n## Intended Use\n- Primary intended uses: NLLB-200 is a machine translation model primarily intended for research in machine translation, - especially for low-resource languages. It allows for single sentence translation among 200 languages. Information on how to - use the model can be found in Fairseq code repository along with the training code and references to evaluation and training data.\n- Primary intended users: Primary users are researchers and machine translation research community.\n- Out-of-scope use cases: NLLB-200 is a research model and is not released for production deployment. NLLB-200 is trained on general domain text data and is not intended to be used with domain specific texts, such as medical domain or legal domain. The model is not intended to be used for document translation. The model was trained with input lengths not exceeding 512 tokens, therefore translating longer sequences might result in quality degradation. NLLB-200 translations can not be used as certified translations. \n\n## Metrics\n\u2022 Model performance measures: NLLB-200 model was evaluated using BLEU, spBLEU, and chrF++ metrics widely adopted by machine translation community. Additionally, we performed human evaluation with the XSTS protocol and measured the toxicity of the generated translations.\n\n\n## Evaluation Data\n- Datasets: Flores-200 dataset is described in Section 4\n- Motivation: We used Flores-200 as it provides full evaluation coverage of the languages in NLLB-200\n- Preprocessing: Sentence-split raw text data was preprocessed using SentencePiece. The\nSentencePiece model is released along with NLLB-200.\n\n## Training Data\n\u2022 We used parallel multilingual data from a variety of sources to train the model. We provide detailed report on data selection and construction process in Section 5 in the paper. We also used monolingual data constructed from Common Crawl. We provide more details in Section 5.2.\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\u2022 In this work, we took a reflexive approach in technological development to ensure that we prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them. While we reflect on our ethical considerations throughout the article, here are some additional points to highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages, with a heavy emphasis on African languages. While quality translation could improve education and information access in many in these communities, such an access could also make groups with lower levels of digital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate our work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Regarding data acquisition, the training data used for model development were mined from various publicly available sources on the web. Although we invested heavily in data cleaning, personally identifiable information may not be entirely eliminated. Finally, although we did our best to optimize for translation quality, mistranslations produced by the model could remain. Although the odds are low, this could have adverse impact on those who rely on these translations to make important decisions (particularly when related to health and safety).\n\n## Caveats and Recommendations\n\u2022 Our model has been tested on the Wikimedia domain with limited investigation on other domains supported in NLLB-MD.

We introduce SMaLL-100, a distilled version of the M2M-100(12B) model, a massively multilingual machine translation model covering 100 languages. We train SMaLL-100 with uniform sampling across all language pairs and therefore focus on preserving the performance of low-resource languages. We evaluate SMaLL-100 on different low-resource benchmarks: FLORES-101, Tatoeba, and TICO-19 and demonstrate that it outperforms previous massively multilingual models of comparable sizes (200-600M) while improving inference latency and memory usage.

Compression techniques allow to drastically reduce the size of the models and therefore their inference time with negligible impact on top-tier metrics. However, the general performance averaged across multiple tasks and/or languages may hide a drastic performance drop on under-represented features, which could result in the amplification of biases encoded by the models. In this work, we assess the impact of compression methods on Multilingual Neural Machine Translation models (MNMT) for various language groups, gender, and semantic biases by extensive analysis of compressed models on different machine translation benchmarks, i.e. FLORES-101, MT-Gender, and DiBiMT. We show that the performance of under-represented languages drops significantly, while the average BLEU metric only slightly decreases. Interestingly, the removal of noisy memorization with compression leads to a significant improvement for some medium-resource languages. Finally, we demonstrate that compression amplifies intrinsic gender and semantic biases, even in high-resource languages.\",\n}\n\n```", "raynardj/wenyanwen-chinese-translate-to-ancient": "\n\n# From

Our text-to-text framework allows us to use the same model, loss function, and hyperparameters on any NLP task.\n\nT5-3B is the checkpoint with 3 billion parameters. \n\n- **Developed by:** Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J.

We can even apply T5 to regression tasks by training it to predict the string representation of a number instead of the number itself.\n\nSee the [blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html) and [research paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf) for further details.\n\n## Out-of-Scope Use\n\nMore information needed.\n\n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\nMore information needed.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nMore information needed.\n\n# Training Details\n\n## Training Data\n\nThe model is pre-trained on the [Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4)](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4), which was developed and released in the context of the same [research paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf) as T5.\n\nThe model was pre-trained on a on a **multi-task mixture of unsupervised (1.) and supervised tasks (2.)**.\nThereby, the following datasets were being used for (1.) and (2.):\n\n1. **Datasets used for Unsupervised denoising objective**:\n\n- [C4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4)\n- [Wiki-DPR](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wiki_dpr)\n\n\n2. **Datasets used for Supervised text-to-text language modeling objective**\n\n- Sentence acceptability judgment\n  - CoLA [Warstadt et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12471)\n- Sentiment analysis \n  - SST-2 [Socher et al., 2013](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/EMNLP2013_RNTN.pdf)\n- Paraphrasing/sentence similarity\n  - MRPC [Dolan and Brockett, 2005](https://aclanthology.org/I05-5002)\n  - STS-B [Ceret al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00055)\n  - QQP [Iyer et al., 2017](https://quoradata.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs)\n- Natural language inference\n  - MNLI [Williams et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05426)\n  - QNLI [Rajpurkar et al.,2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250)\n  - RTE [Dagan et al., 2005](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11736790_9) \n  - CB [De Marneff et al., 2019](https://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/Tg3ZGI2M/Marneffe.pdf)\n- Sentence completion\n  - COPA [Roemmele et al., 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221251392_Choice_of_Plausible_Alternatives_An_Evaluation_of_Commonsense_Causal_Reasoning)\n- Word sense disambiguation\n  - WIC [Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09121)\n- Question answering\n  - MultiRC [Khashabi et al., 2018](https://aclanthology.org/N18-1023)\n  - ReCoRD [Zhang et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12885)\n  - BoolQ [Clark et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10044)\n\n## Training Procedure\n\nIn their [abstract](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf), the model developers write: \n\n> In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. \n\nThe framework introduced, the T5 framework, involves a training procedure that brings together the approaches studied in the paper.

To load the model in [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/):\n```python\nreader = FARMReader(model_name_or_path=\"deepset/roberta-base-squad2\")\n# or \nreader = TransformersReader(model_name_or_path=\"deepset/roberta-base-squad2\",tokenizer=\"deepset/roberta-base-squad2\")\n```\nFor a complete example of ``roberta-base-squad2`` being used for  Question Answering, check out the [Tutorials in Haystack Documentation](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/first-qa-system)\n\n### In Transformers\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, AutoTokenizer, pipeline\n\nmodel_name = \"deepset/roberta-base-squad2\"\n\n# a) Get predictions\nnlp = pipeline('question-answering', model=model_name, tokenizer=model_name)\nQA_input = {\n    'question': 'Why is model conversion important?',\n    'context': 'The option to convert models between FARM and transformers gives freedom to the user and let people easily switch between frameworks.'\n}\nres = nlp(QA_input)\n\n# b) Load model & tokenizer\nmodel = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n```\n\n## Performance\nEvaluated on the SQuAD 2.0 dev set with the [official eval script](https://worksheets.codalab.org/rest/bundles/0x6b567e1cf2e041ec80d7098f031c5c9e/contents/blob/).\n\n```\n\"exact\": 79.87029394424324,\n\"f1\": 82.91251169582613,\n\n\"total\": 11873,\n\"HasAns_exact\": 77.93522267206478,\n\"HasAns_f1\": 84.02838248389763,\n\"HasAns_total\": 5928,\n\"NoAns_exact\": 81.79983179142137,\n\"NoAns_f1\": 81.79983179142137,\n\"NoAns_total\": 5945\n```\n\n## Authors\n**Branden Chan:** branden.chan@deepset.ai  \n**Timo M\u00f6ller:** timo.moeller@deepset.ai  \n**Malte Pietsch:** malte.pietsch@deepset.ai  \n**Tanay Soni:**  tanay.soni@deepset.ai \n\n## About us\n\n<div class=\"grid lg:grid-cols-2 gap-x-4 gap-y-3\">\n    <div class=\"w-full h-40 object-cover mb-2 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center\">\n         <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepset-ai/.github/main/deepset-logo-colored.png\" class=\"w-40\"/>\n     </div>\n     <div class=\"w-full h-40 object-cover mb-2 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center\">\n         <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepset-ai/.github/main/haystack-logo-colored.png\" class=\"w-40\"/>\n     </div>\n</div>\n\n[deepset](http://deepset.ai/) is the company behind the open-source NLP framework [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) which is designed to help you build production ready NLP systems that use: Question answering, summarization, ranking etc.\n\n\nSome of our other work: \n- [Distilled roberta-base-squad2 (aka \"tinyroberta-squad2\")]([https://huggingface.co/deepset/tinyroberta-squad2)\n- [German BERT (aka \"bert-base-german-cased\")](https://deepset.ai/german-bert)\n- [GermanQuAD and GermanDPR datasets and models (aka \"gelectra-base-germanquad\", \"gbert-base-germandpr\")](https://deepset.ai/germanquad)\n\n## Get in touch and join the Haystack community\n\n<p>For more info on Haystack, visit our <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack\">GitHub</a></strong> repo and <strong><a href=\"https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai\">Documentation</a></strong>. \n\nWe also have a <strong><a class=\"h-7\" href=\"https://haystack.deepset.ai/community\">Discord community open to everyone!</a></strong></p>\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/deepset_ai) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepset-ai/) | [Discord](https://haystack.deepset.ai/community) | [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/discussions) | [Website](https://deepset.ai)\n\nBy the way: [we're hiring!](http://www.deepset.ai/jobs) \n", "distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad": "\n\n# DistilBERT base cased distilled SQuAD\n\n## Table of Contents\n- [Model Details](#model-details)\n- [How To Get Started With the Model](#how-to-get-started-with-the-model)\n- [Uses](#uses)\n- [Risks, Limitations and Biases](#risks-limitations-and-biases)\n- [Training](#training)\n- [Evaluation](#evaluation)\n- [Environmental Impact](#environmental-impact)\n- [Technical Specifications](#technical-specifications)\n- [Citation Information](#citation-information)\n- [Model Card Authors](#model-card-authors)\n\n## Model Details\n\n**Model Description:** The DistilBERT model was proposed in the blog post [Smaller, faster, cheaper, lighter: Introducing DistilBERT, adistilled version of BERT](https://medium.com/huggingface/distilbert-8cf3380435b5), and the paper [DistilBERT, adistilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108). DistilBERT is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model trained by distilling BERT base. It has 40% less parameters than *bert-base-uncased*, runs 60% faster while preserving over 95% of BERT's performances as measured on the GLUE language understanding benchmark.\n\nThis model is a fine-tune checkpoint of [DistilBERT-base-cased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-cased), fine-tuned using (a second step of) knowledge distillation on [SQuAD v1.1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad). \n\n- **Developed by:** Hugging Face\n- **Model Type:** Transformer-based language model\n- **Language(s):** English \n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Related Models:** [DistilBERT-base-cased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-cased)\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - See [this repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/distillation) for more about Distil\\* (a class of compressed models including this model)\n  - See [Sanh et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) for more information about knowledge distillation and the training procedure\n\n## How to Get Started with the Model \n\nUse the code below to get started with the model. \n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> question_answerer = pipeline(\"question-answering\", model='distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad')\n\n>>> context = r\"\"\"\n... Extractive Question Answering is the task of extracting an answer from a text given a question. An example     of a\n... question answering dataset is the SQuAD dataset, which is entirely based on that task. If you would like to fine-tune\n... a model on a SQuAD task, you may leverage the examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_squad.py script.\n... \"\"\"\n\n>>> result = question_answerer(question=\"What is a good example of a question answering dataset?\",     context=context)\n>>> print(\n... f\"Answer: '{result['answer']}', score: {round(result['score'], 4)}, start: {result['start']}, end: {result['end']}\"\n...)\n\nAnswer: 'SQuAD dataset', score: 0.5152, start: 147, end: 160\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, DistilBertModel\nimport torch\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad')\nmodel = DistilBertModel.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad')\n\nquestion, text = \"Who was Jim Henson?\", \"Jim Henson was a nice puppet\"\n\ninputs = tokenizer(question, text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\n\nprint(outputs)\n```\n\nAnd in TensorFlow: \n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, TFDistilBertForQuestionAnswering\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad\")\nmodel = TFDistilBertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad\")\n\nquestion, text = \"Who was Jim Henson?\", \"Jim Henson was a nice puppet\"\n\ninputs = tokenizer(question, text, return_tensors=\"tf\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\nanswer_start_index = int(tf.math.argmax(outputs.start_logits, axis=-1)[0])\nanswer_end_index = int(tf.math.argmax(outputs.end_logits, axis=-1)[0])\n\npredict_answer_tokens = inputs.input_ids[0, answer_start_index : answer_end_index + 1]\ntokenizer.decode(predict_answer_tokens)\n```\n\n## Uses\n\nThis model can be used for question answering.\n\n#### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. In addition, the model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be aware that language generated by this model can be disturbing or offensive to some and can propagate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model can include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups. For example:\n\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> question_answerer = pipeline(\"question-answering\", model='distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad')\n\n>>> context = r\"\"\"\n... Alice is sitting on the bench. Bob is sitting next to her.\n... \"\"\"\n\n>>> result = question_answerer(question=\"Who is the CEO?\", context=context)\n>>> print(\n... f\"Answer: '{result['answer']}', score: {round(result['score'], 4)}, start: {result['start']}, end: {result['end']}\"\n...)\n\nAnswer: 'Bob', score: 0.7527, start: 32, end: 35\n```\n\nUsers (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.\n\n## Training\n\n#### Training Data\n\nThe [distilbert-base-cased model](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-cased) was trained using the same data as the [distilbert-base-uncased model](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased).

It was introduced in\n[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and first released in\n[this repository](https://github.com/google-research/bert). This model is uncased: it does not make a difference\nbetween english and English.\n\nDifferently to other BERT models, this model was trained with a new technique: Whole Word Masking. In this case, all of the tokens corresponding to a word are masked at once. The overall masking rate remains the same.\n\nThe training is identical -- each masked WordPiece token is predicted independently. \n\nAfter pre-training, this model was fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset with one of our fine-tuning scripts. See below for more information regarding this fine-tuning.\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing BERT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by\nthe Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nBERT is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it\nwas pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of\npublicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it\nwas pretrained with two objectives:\n\n- Masked language modeling (MLM): taking a sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run\n  the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict the masked words. This is different from traditional\n  recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like\n  GPT which internally mask the future tokens. It allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the\n  sentence.\n- Next sentence prediction (NSP): the models concatenates two masked sentences as inputs during pretraining. Sometimes\n  they correspond to sentences that were next to each other in the original text, sometimes not. The model then has to\n  predict if the two sentences were following each other or not.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features\nuseful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences for instance, you can train a standard\nclassifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.\n\nThis model has the following configuration:\n\n- 24-layer\n- 1024 hidden dimension\n- 16 attention heads\n- 336M parameters.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\nThis model should be used as a question-answering model. You may use it in a question answering pipeline, or use it to output raw results given a query and a context. You may see other use cases in the [task summary](https://huggingface.co/transformers/task_summary.html#extractive-question-answering) of the transformers documentation.## Training data\n\nThe BERT model was pretrained on [BookCorpus](https://yknzhu.wixsite.com/mbweb), a dataset consisting of 11,038\nunpublished books and [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia) (excluding lists, tables and\nheaders).\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are lowercased and tokenized using WordPiece and a vocabulary size of 30,000. The inputs of the model are\nthen of the form:\n\n```\n[CLS] Sentence A [SEP] Sentence B [SEP]\n```\n\nWith probability 0.5, sentence A and sentence B correspond to two consecutive sentences in the original corpus and in\nthe other cases, it's another random sentence in the corpus. Note that what is considered a sentence here is a\nconsecutive span of text usually longer than a single sentence. The only constrain is that the result with the two\n\"sentences\" has a combined length of less than 512 tokens.\n\nThe details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:\n- 15% of the tokens are masked.\n- In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by `[MASK]`.\n- In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.\n- In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on 4 cloud TPUs in Pod configuration (16 TPU chips total) for one million steps with a batch size\nof 256. The sequence length was limited to 128 tokens for 90% of the steps and 512 for the remaining 10%. The optimizer\nused is Adam with a learning rate of 1e-4, \\\\(\\beta_{1} = 0.9\\\\) and \\\\(\\beta_{2} = 0.999\\\\), a weight decay of 0.01,\nlearning rate warmup for 10,000 steps and linear decay of the learning rate after.\n\n### Fine-tuning\n\nAfter pre-training, this model was fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset with one of our fine-tuning scripts. In order to reproduce the training, you may use the following command:\n```\npython -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 ./examples/question-answering/run_qa.py \\\n    --model_name_or_path bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking \\\n    --dataset_name squad \\\n    --do_train \\\n    --do_eval \\\n    --learning_rate 3e-5 \\\n    --num_train_epochs 2 \\\n    --max_seq_length 384 \\\n    --doc_stride 128 \\\n    --output_dir ./examples/models/wwm_uncased_finetuned_squad/ \\\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size=3   \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size=3   \\\n```\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nThe results obtained are the following:\n\n```\nf1 = 93.15\nexact_match = 86.91\n```\n\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805,\n  author    = {Jacob Devlin and\n               Ming{-}Wei Chang and\n               Kenton Lee and\n               Kristina Toutanova},\n  title     = {{BERT:} Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language\n               Understanding},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1810.04805},\n  year      = {2018},\n  url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprint    = {1810.04805},\n  timestamp = {Tue, 30 Oct 2018 20:39:56 +0100},\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-1810-04805.bib},\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n```", "luhua/chinese_pretrain_mrc_roberta_wwm_ext_large": "\n\n## Chinese MRC roberta_wwm_ext_large\n\n* \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u4e2d\u6587MRC\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684roberta_wwm_ext_large\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be6\u60c5\u53ef\u67e5\u770b\uff1ahttps://github.com/basketballandlearn/MRC_Competition_Dureader\n* \u6b64\u5e93\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728 \u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3/\u5206\u7c7b \u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8<br/>\n\uff08\u5df2\u6709\u591a\u4f4d\u5c0f\u4f19\u4f34\u5728Dureader-2021\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97**top5**\u7684\u6210\u7ee9\ud83d\ude01\uff09\n\n|                \u6a21\u578b/\u6570\u636e\u96c6                 |  Dureader-2021  |  tencentmedical |\n| ", "uer/roberta-base-chinese-extractive-qa": "\n\n# Chinese RoBERTa-Base Model for QA\n\n## Model description\n\nThe model is used for extractive question answering.

Authors](#model-card-authors)\n\n## Model Details\n\n**Model Description:** The DistilBERT model was proposed in the blog post [Smaller, faster, cheaper, lighter: Introducing DistilBERT, adistilled version of BERT](https://medium.com/huggingface/distilbert-8cf3380435b5), and the paper [DistilBERT, adistilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108). DistilBERT is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model trained by distilling BERT base. It has 40% less parameters than *bert-base-uncased*, runs 60% faster while preserving over 95% of BERT's performances as measured on the GLUE language understanding benchmark.\n\nThis model is a fine-tune checkpoint of [DistilBERT-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased), fine-tuned using (a second step of) knowledge distillation on [SQuAD v1.1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad). \n\n- **Developed by:** Hugging Face\n- **Model Type:** Transformer-based language model\n- **Language(s):** English \n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Related Models:** [DistilBERT-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased)\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - See [this repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/distillation) for more about Distil\\* (a class of compressed models including this model)\n  - See [Sanh et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) for more information about knowledge distillation and the training procedure\n\n## How to Get Started with the Model \n\nUse the code below to get started with the model. \n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> question_answerer = pipeline(\"question-answering\", model='distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad')\n\n>>> context = r\"\"\"\n... Extractive Question Answering is the task of extracting an answer from a text given a question. An example     of a\n... question answering dataset is the SQuAD dataset, which is entirely based on that task. If you would like to fine-tune\n... a model on a SQuAD task, you may leverage the examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_squad.py script.\n... \"\"\"\n\n>>> result = question_answerer(question=\"What is a good example of a question answering dataset?\",     context=context)\n>>> print(\n... f\"Answer: '{result['answer']}', score: {round(result['score'], 4)}, start: {result['start']}, end: {result['end']}\"\n...)\n\nAnswer: 'SQuAD dataset', score: 0.4704, start: 147, end: 160\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, DistilBertForQuestionAnswering\nimport torch\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad')\nmodel = DistilBertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad')\n\nquestion, text = \"Who was Jim Henson?\", \"Jim Henson was a nice puppet\"\n\ninputs = tokenizer(question, text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\n\nanswer_start_index = torch.argmax(outputs.start_logits)\nanswer_end_index = torch.argmax(outputs.end_logits)\n\npredict_answer_tokens = inputs.input_ids[0, answer_start_index : answer_end_index + 1]\ntokenizer.decode(predict_answer_tokens)\n```\n\nAnd in TensorFlow: \n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, TFDistilBertForQuestionAnswering\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad\")\nmodel = TFDistilBertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad\")\n\nquestion, text = \"Who was Jim Henson?\", \"Jim Henson was a nice puppet\"\n\ninputs = tokenizer(question, text, return_tensors=\"tf\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\nanswer_start_index = int(tf.math.argmax(outputs.start_logits, axis=-1)[0])\nanswer_end_index = int(tf.math.argmax(outputs.end_logits, axis=-1)[0])\n\npredict_answer_tokens = inputs.input_ids[0, answer_start_index : answer_end_index + 1]\ntokenizer.decode(predict_answer_tokens)\n```\n\n## Uses\n\nThis model can be used for question answering.\n\n#### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. In addition, the model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be aware that language generated by this model can be disturbing or offensive to some and can propagate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model can include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups. For example:\n\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> question_answerer = pipeline(\"question-answering\", model='distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad')\n\n>>> context = r\"\"\"\n... Alice is sitting on the bench. Bob is sitting next to her.\n... \"\"\"\n\n>>> result = question_answerer(question=\"Who is the CEO?\", context=context)\n>>> print(\n... f\"Answer: '{result['answer']}', score: {round(result['score'], 4)}, start: {result['start']}, end: {result['end']}\"\n...)\n\nAnswer: 'Bob', score: 0.4183, start: 32, end: 35\n```\n\nUsers (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.\n\n## Training\n\n#### Training Data\n\nThe [distilbert-base-uncased model](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) model describes it's training data as: \n\n> DistilBERT pretrained on the same data as BERT, which is [BookCorpus](https://yknzhu.wixsite.com/mbweb), a dataset consisting of 11,038 unpublished books and [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia) (excluding lists, tables and headers).\n\nTo learn more about the SQuAD v1.1 dataset, see the [SQuAD v1.1 data card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad).\n\n#### Training Procedure\n\n##### Preprocessing\n\nSee the [distilbert-base-uncased model card](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) for further details.\n\n##### Pretraining\n\nSee the [distilbert-base-uncased model card](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) for further details. \n\n## Evaluation\n\nAs discussed in the [model repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/research_projects/distillation/README.md)\n\n> This model reaches a F1 score of 86.9 on the [SQuAD v1.1] dev set (for comparison, Bert bert-base-uncased version reaches a F1 score of 88.5).\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al.

With those two improvements, DeBERTa out perform RoBERTa on a majority of NLU tasks with 80GB training data. \n\nIn [DeBERTa V3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09543), we further improved the efficiency of DeBERTa using ELECTRA-Style pre-training with Gradient Disentangled Embedding Sharing. Compared to DeBERTa,  our V3 version significantly improves the model performance on downstream tasks.  You can find more technique details about the new model from our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09543).\n\nPlease check the [official repository](https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa) for more implementation details and updates.\n\nmDeBERTa is multilingual version of DeBERTa which use the same structure as DeBERTa and was trained with CC100 multilingual data.\nThe mDeBERTa V3 base model comes with 12 layers and a hidden size of 768.

Details\n- We trained a German question answering model with a gelectra-large model as its basis.\n- The dataset is GermanQuAD, a new, German language dataset, which we hand-annotated and published [online](https://deepset.ai/germanquad).\n- The training dataset is one-way annotated and contains 11518 questions and 11518 answers, while the test dataset is three-way annotated so that there are 2204 questions and with 2204\u00b73\u221276 = 6536 answers, because we removed 76 wrong answers.\n\nSee https://deepset.ai/germanquad for more details and dataset download in SQuAD format.\n\n## Hyperparameters\n```\nbatch_size = 24\nn_epochs = 2\nmax_seq_len = 384\nlearning_rate = 3e-5\nlr_schedule = LinearWarmup\nembeds_dropout_prob = 0.1\n```\n## Performance\nWe evaluated the extractive question answering performance on our GermanQuAD test set.\nModel types and training data are included in the model name. \nFor finetuning XLM-Roberta, we use the English SQuAD v2.0 dataset.\nThe GELECTRA models are warm started on the German translation of SQuAD v1.1 and finetuned on [GermanQuAD](https://deepset.ai/germanquad). \nThe human baseline was computed for the 3-way test set by taking one answer as prediction and the other two as ground truth.\n![performancetable](https://images.prismic.io/deepset/1c63afd8-40e6-4fd9-85c4-0dbb81996183_german-qa-vs-xlm-r.png) \n\n## Authors\n

Details\n- We trained a German question answering model with a gelectra-base model as its basis.\n- The dataset is GermanQuAD, a new, German language dataset, which we hand-annotated and published [online](https://deepset.ai/germanquad).\n- The training dataset is one-way annotated and contains 11518 questions and 11518 answers, while the test dataset is three-way annotated so that there are 2204 questions and with 2204\u00b73\u221276 = 6536answers, because we removed 76 wrong answers.\n\nSee https://deepset.ai/germanquad for more details and dataset download in SQuAD format.\n\n##

question answering performance on our GermanQuAD test set.\nModel types and training data are included in the model name. \nFor finetuning XLM-Roberta, we use the English SQuAD v2.0 dataset.\nThe GELECTRA models are warm started on the German translation of SQuAD v1.1 and finetuned on [GermanQuAD](https://deepset.ai/germanquad).\nThe human baseline was computed for the 3-way test set by taking one answer as prediction and the other two as ground truth.  \n![performancetable](https://images.prismic.io/deepset/1c63afd8-40e6-4fd9-85c4-0dbb81996183_german-qa-vs-xlm-r.png) \n\n## Authors\n**Timo

But For QA, all question tokens should  have global attention. For more details on this please refer the paper. The `LongformerForQuestionAnswering` model automatically does that for you. To allow it to do that \n1. The input sequence must have three sep tokens, i.e the sequence should be encoded like this\n   ` <s> question</s></s> context</s>`.  If you encode the question and answer as a input  pair, then the tokenizer already takes care of that, you shouldn't worry about it.\n2. `input_ids` should always be a batch of examples. \n\n## Results\n|Metric       | # Value |\n|", "hfl/chinese-pert-base-mrc": "\n\n## A Chinese MRC model built on Chinese PERT-base\n\n**Please use `BertForQuestionAnswering` to load this model!**\n\nThis is a Chinese machine reading comprehension (MRC) model built on PERT-base and fine-tuned on a mixture of Chinese MRC datasets.\n\nPERT is a pre-trained model based on permuted language model (PerLM) to learn text semantic information in a self-supervised manner without introducing the mask tokens [MASK].

This notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/PygmalionAI/gradio-ui/blob/master/notebooks/GPU.ipynb).\n\n### The manual way\n\nThe model can be used as a regular text generation model, but it'll perform best if the input prompt adheres to the following format:\n\n```\n[CHARACTER]'s Persona: [A few sentences about the character you want the model to play]\n<START>\n[DIALOGUE HISTORY]\nYou: [Your input message here]\n[CHARACTER]:\n```\n\nWhere `[CHARACTER]` is, as you can probably guess, the name of the character you want the model to portray, `<START>` should be used verbatim as a delimiter token to separate persona and scenario data from the dialogue, and `[DIALOGUE HISTORY]` is chat history so the model can have some conversational context to draw from. Ideally it'll be pairs of messages like:\n\n```\n[CHARACTER]: [some dialogue here]\nYou: [your response to the dialogue above]\n```\n\nApart from chat history, you can also just add example conversations in `[DIALOGUE HISTORY]` to show how the character should speak - ideally at the beginning, so it doesn't get confused as to what's conversation history vs. character definition.\n\n## Known issues\n\nWe haven't played around with the model enough to enumerate them.

Furthermore, some active learning was used to train the model to do _controlled_ decoding using turn-level goals.\n\n## Full Repo\n\nPreprocessing, training and implementation details can be found in the [personaGPT repo](https://github.com/af1tang/personaGPT).\n\n### How to Use\n\n\n1. Load the model and define some helper functions.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel\nimport torch\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"af1tang/personaGPT\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"af1tang/personaGPT\")\nif torch.cuda.is_available():\n\tmodel = model.cuda()\n## utility functions ##\nflatten = lambda l: [item for sublist in l for item in sublist]\n\ndef to_data(x):\n    if torch.cuda.is_available():\n        x = x.cpu()\n    return x.data.numpy()\n\ndef to_var(x):\n    if not torch.is_tensor(x):\n        x = torch.Tensor(x)\n    if torch.cuda.is_available():\n        x = x.cuda()\n    return x\n\ndef display_dialog_history(dialog_hx):\n    for j, line in enumerate(dialog_hx):\n        msg = tokenizer.decode(line)\n        if j %2 == 0:\n            print(\">> User: \"+ msg)\n        else:\n            print(\"Bot: \"+msg)\n            print()\n\ndef generate_next(bot_input_ids, do_sample=True, top_k=10, top_p=.92,\n                  max_length=1000, pad_token=tokenizer.eos_token_id):\n    full_msg = model.generate(bot_input_ids, do_sample=True,\n                                              top_k=top_k, top_p=top_p, \n                                              max_length=max_length, pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id)\n    msg = to_data(full_msg.detach()[0])[bot_input_ids.shape[-1]:]\n    return msg\n```\n\n2. Give your chatbot partner a set of personalities. \n\n\n```python\n# get personality facts for conversation\npersonas = []\nfor i in range(3):\n    response = input(\">> Fact %d: \"%(i+1))+ tokenizer.eos_token\n    personas.append(response)\npersonas = tokenizer.encode(''.join(['<|p2|>'] + personas + ['<|sep|>'] + ['<|start|>']))\n```\n\n3. The first use of PersonaGPT is to do _personalized_ dialog generation. Use the following loop to interact with the model.\n\n```python\n# converse for 8 turns\ndialog_hx = []\nfor step in range(8):\n    # encode the user input\n    user_inp = tokenizer.encode(input(\">> User: \") + tokenizer.eos_token)\n    # append to the chat history\n    dialog_hx.append(user_inp)\n        \n    # generated a response while limiting the total chat history to 1000 tokens, \n    bot_input_ids = to_var([personas + flatten(dialog_hx)]).long()\n    msg = generate_next(bot_input_ids)\n    dialog_hx.append(msg)\n    print(\"Bot: {}\".format(tokenizer.decode(msg, skip_special_tokens=True)))\n```\n\n\nExample of personalized decoding:\n\n| | Persona Facts |\n|", "microsoft/GODEL-v1_1-large-seq2seq": "\n\n### Large-Scale Pre-Training for Goal-Directed Dialog (GODEL)\n\nGODEL is a large-scale pre-trained model for goal-directed dialogs.

Ideally it'll be pairs of messages like:\n\n```\n[CHARACTER]: [some dialogue here]\nYou: [your response to the dialogue above]\n```\n\nApart from chat history, you can also just add example conversations in `[DIALOGUE HISTORY]` to show how the character should speak - ideally at the beginning, so it doesn't get confused as to what's conversation history vs. character definition.\n\n## Known issues\n\n- The model can get stuck repeating certain phrases, or sometimes even entire sentences.\n  - We believe this is due to that behavior being present in the training data itself, and plan to investigate and adjust accordingly for future versions.\n", "deepparag/Aeona": "\n\n# Aeona | Chatbot\n![Aeona Banner](https://github.com/deepsarda/Aeona/blob/master/dashboard/static/banner.png?raw=true)\n\n\n\nAn generative AI made using [microsoft/DialoGPT-small](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-small).\n\n\nRecommended to use along with an [AIML Chatbot](https://github.com/deepsarda/Aeona-Aiml) to reduce load, get better replies, add name and personality to your bot.\nUsing an AIML Chatbot will allow you to hardcode some replies also.\n\n# AEONA\nAeona is an chatbot which hope's to be able to talk with humans as if its an friend!\nIt's main target platform is discord. \nYou can invite the bot [here](https://aeona.xyz).\n\nTo learn more about this project and chat with the ai, you can use this [website](https://aeona.xyz/).\n\nAeona works why using context of the previous messages and guessing the personality of the human who is talking with it and adapting its own personality to better talk with the user.\n\n# Participate and Help the AI improve or just hang out at [hugging face discussions](https://huggingface.co/deepparag/Aeona/discussions)\n\n## Goals\n The goal is to create an AI which will work with AIML in order to create the most human like AI.\n \n #### Why not an AI on its own?\n For AI it is not possible (realistically) to learn about the user and store data on them, when compared to an AIML which can even execute code!\n The goal of the AI is to generate responses where the AIML fails.\n \n Hence the goals becomes to make an AI which has a wide variety of knowledge, yet be as small as possible!\n So we use 3 dataset:-\n 1. [Movielines](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/movie-dialog-corpus) The movie lines promote longer and more thought out responses but it can be very random. About 200k lines!\n 2. [Discord Messages](https://www.kaggle.com/jef1056/discord-data) The messages are on a wide variety of topics filtered and removed spam which makes the AI highly random but gives it a very random response to every days questions! about 120 million messages!\n 3. Custom dataset scrapped from my messages, These messages are very narrow teaching this dataset and sending a random reply will make the AI say sorry loads of time!\n    \n## Training\n The Discord Messages Dataset simply dwarfs the other datasets, Hence the data sets are repeated.\n This leads to them covering each others issues!\n  \n The AI has a context of 6 messages which means it will reply until the 4th message from user.\n [Example](https://huggingface.co/deepparag/Aeona-Beta/discussions/1)\n \n## Tips for Hugging Face interference\n    I recommend send the user input,\n    previous 3 AI and human responses.\n    \n    Using more context than this will lead to useless responses but using less is alright but the responses may be random.  \n## Evaluation \nBelow is a comparison of Aeona vs. other baselines on the mixed dataset given above using automatic evaluation metrics.\n\n| Model | Perplexity |\n|", "r3dhummingbird/DialoGPT-medium-joshua": "\n\n# DialoGPT Trained on the Speech of a Game Character\n\nThis is an instance of [microsoft/DialoGPT-medium](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium) trained on a game character, Joshua from [The World Ends With You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Ends_with_You).

While prior work has shown that scaling neural models in the number of parameters and the size of the data they are trained on gives improved results, we show that other ingredients are important for a high-performing chatbot. Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements. We then discuss the limitations of this work by analyzing failure cases of our models.\n\n", "PaddlePaddle/plato-mini": "\n\n[![paddlenlp-banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1371212/175816733-8ec25eb0-9af3-4380-9218-27c154518258.png)](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleNLP)\n\n# PaddlePaddle/plato-mini\n\n## Introduction\n\nPre-training models have been proved effective for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. \nInspired by this, we propose a novel dialogue generation pre-training framework to support various kinds of conversations, \nincluding chit-chat, knowledge grounded dialogues, and conversational question answering. In this framework, we adopt flexible \nattention mechanisms to fully leverage the bi-directional context and the uni-directional characteristic of language generation. \nWe also introduce discrete latent variables to tackle the inherent one-to-many mapping problem in response generation. \nTwo reciprocal tasks of response generation and latent act recognition are designed and carried out simultaneously within a shared network. \nComprehensive experiments on three publicly available datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.\n\nMore detail: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07931\n\n## Available Models\n\n- **plato-mini**, *6 layer, 12 heads, 768 hidden size*\n\n## How to Use?\n\nClick on the *Use in paddlenlp* button on the top right!\n\n## Citation Info\n\n```text\n@article{ernie2.0,\n  title = {PLATO: Pre-trained Dialogue Generation Model with Discrete Latent Variable},\n  author = {Bao, Siqi and He, Huang and Wang, Fan and Wu, Hua and Wang, Haifeng},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.07931},\n  year = {2019},\n}\n```\n\n\n", "byeongal/Ko-DialoGPT": "\n## Ko-DialoGPT\n\n\n### How to use\n```python\nfrom transformers import PreTrainedTokenizerFast, GPT2LMHeadModel\nimport torch\n\n\ndevice = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'\n\ntokenizer = PreTrainedTokenizerFast.from_pretrained('byeongal/Ko-DialoGPT')\nmodel = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('byeongal/Ko-DialoGPT').to(device)\n\npast_user_inputs = []\ngenerated_responses = []\n\nwhile True:\n    user_input = input(\">> User:\")\n    if user_input == 'bye':\n        break\n    text_idx = tokenizer.encode(user_input + tokenizer.eos_token, return_tensors='pt')\n    for i in range(len(generated_responses)-1, len(generated_responses)-3, -1):\n        if i < 0:\n            break\n        encoded_vector = tokenizer.encode(generated_responses[i] + tokenizer.eos_token, return_tensors='pt')\n        if text_idx.shape[-1] + encoded_vector.shape[-1] < 1000:\n            text_idx = torch.cat([encoded_vector, text_idx], dim=-1)\n        else:\n            break\n        encoded_vector = tokenizer.encode(past_user_inputs[i] + tokenizer.eos_token, return_tensors='pt')\n        if text_idx.shape[-1] + encoded_vector.shape[-1] < 1000:\n            text_idx = torch.cat([encoded_vector, text_idx], dim=-1)\n        else:\n            break\n    text_idx = text_idx.to(device)\n    inference_output = model.generate(\n            text_idx,\n            max_length=1000,\n            num_beams=5,\n            top_k=20,\n            no_repeat_ngram_size=4,\n            length_penalty=0.65,\n            repetition_penalty=2.0,\n        )\n    inference_output = inference_output.tolist()\n    bot_response = tokenizer.decode(inference_output[0][text_idx.shape[-1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)\n    print(f\"Bot: {bot_response}\")\n    past_user_inputs.append(user_input)\n    generated_responses.append(bot_response)\n```\n\n### Reference\n* [SKT-KoGPT2](https://huggingface.co/skt/kogpt2-base-v2)\n* [KETI R&D \ub370\uc774\ud130](https://aihub.or.kr/opendata/keti-data/recognition-laguage/KETI-02-008)\n* [\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \ub300\ud654 \uc694\uc57d](https://aihub.or.kr/aidata/30714)\n", "BlackSamorez/rudialogpt3_medium_based_on_gpt2_2ch": "\n\nDialoGPT on Russian language\n\n\nBased on [Grossmend/rudialogpt3_medium_based_on_gpt2](https://huggingface.co/Grossmend/rudialogpt3_medium_based_on_gpt2)\n\nFine tuned on [2ch /b/ dialogues](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BlackSamorez/2ch_b_dialogues) data.

This\nmeans it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots\nof publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely,\nit was trained to guess the next word in sentences.\n\nMore precisely, inputs are sequences of continuous text of a certain length and the targets are the same sequence,\nshifted one token (word or piece of word) to the right. The model uses internally a mask-mechanism to make sure the\npredictions for the token `i` only uses the inputs from `1` to `i` but not the future tokens.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features\nuseful for downstream tasks. The model is best at what it was pretrained for however, which is generating texts from a\nprompt.\n\nThis is the **smallest** version of GPT-2, with 124M parameters. \n\n**Related Models:** [GPT-Large](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-large), [GPT-Medium](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-medium) and [GPT-XL](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-xl)\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for text generation or fine-tune it to a downstream task. See the\n[model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=gpt2) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. Since the generation relies on some randomness, we\nset a seed for reproducibility:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')\n>>> set_seed(42)\n>>> generator(\"Hello, I'm a language model,\", max_length=30, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n[{'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, a language for thinking, a language for expressing thoughts.\"},\n {'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, a compiler, a compiler library, I just want to know how I build this kind of stuff. I don\"},\n {'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, and also have more than a few of your own, but I understand that they're going to need some help\"},\n {'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, a system model. I want to know my language so that it might be more interesting, more user-friendly\"},\n {'generated_text': 'Hello, I\\'m a language model, not a language model\"\\n\\nThe concept of \"no-tricks\" comes in handy later with new'}]\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2Model\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')\nmodel = GPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, TFGPT2Model\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')\nmodel = TFGPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThe training data used for this model has not been released as a dataset one can browse. We know it contains a lot of\nunfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral. As the openAI team themselves point out in their\n[model card](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/model_card.md#out-of-scope-use-cases):\n\n> Because large-scale language models like GPT-2 do not distinguish fact from fiction, we don\u2019t support use-cases\n> that require the generated text to be true.\n>\n> Additionally, language models like GPT-2 reflect the biases inherent to the systems they were trained on, so we do\n> not recommend that they be deployed into systems that interact with humans > unless the deployers first carry out a\n> study of biases relevant to the intended use-case. We found no statistically significant difference in gender, race,\n> and religious bias probes between 774M and 1.5B, implying all versions of GPT-2 should be approached with similar\n> levels of caution around use cases that are sensitive to biases around human attributes.\n\nHere's an example of how the model can have biased predictions:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')\n>>> set_seed(42)\n>>> generator(\"The White man worked as a\", max_length=10, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n[{'generated_text': 'The White man worked as a mannequin for'},\n {'generated_text': 'The White man worked as a maniser of the'},\n {'generated_text': 'The White man worked as a bus conductor by day'},\n {'generated_text': 'The White man worked as a plumber at the'},\n {'generated_text': 'The White man worked as a journalist. He had'}]\n\n>>> set_seed(42)\n>>> generator(\"The Black man worked as a\", max_length=10, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n[{'generated_text': 'The Black man worked as a man at a restaurant'},\n {'generated_text': 'The Black man worked as a car salesman in a'},\n {'generated_text': 'The Black man worked as a police sergeant at the'},\n {'generated_text': 'The Black man worked as a man-eating monster'},\n {'generated_text': 'The Black man worked as a slave, and was'}]\n```\n\nThis bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe OpenAI team wanted to train this model on a corpus as large as possible. To build it, they scraped all the web\npages from outbound links on Reddit which received at least 3 karma. Note that all Wikipedia pages were removed from\nthis dataset, so the model was not trained on any part of Wikipedia. The resulting dataset (called WebText) weights\n40GB of texts but has not been publicly released. You can find a list of the top 1,000 domains present in WebText\n[here](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/domains.txt).\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are tokenized using a byte-level version of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (for unicode characters) and a\nvocabulary size of 50,257. The inputs are sequences of 1024 consecutive tokens.\n\nThe larger model was trained on 256 cloud TPU v3 cores. The training duration was not disclosed, nor were the exact\ndetails of training.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nThe model achieves the following results without any fine-tuning (zero-shot):\n\n| Dataset  | LAMBADA | LAMBADA | CBT-CN | CBT-NE | WikiText2 | PTB    | enwiki8 | text8  | WikiText103 | 1BW   |\n|:", "togethercomputer/GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B": "\n \n***<p style=\"font-size: 24px\">Feel free to try out our [OpenChatKit feedback app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit)!</p>***\n\n# GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B-v0.16\n\n> TLDR: As part of OpenChatKit (codebase available [here](https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChaT)),\n> GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B-v0.16 is a 20B parameter language model, fine-tuned from EleutherAI\u2019s GPT-NeoX with over 40 million instructions on 100% carbon negative compute.\n\nGPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B-v0.16 is based on ElutherAI\u2019s GPT-NeoX model, and is fine-tuned with data focusing on dialog-style interactions. \nWe focused the tuning on several tasks such as question answering, classification, extraction, and summarization. \nWe\u2019ve fine-tuned the model with a collection of 43 million high-quality instructions.\nTogether partnered with LAION and Ontocord.ai, who both helped curate the dataset the model is based on.\nYou can read more about this process and the availability of this dataset in LAION\u2019s blog post [here](https://laion.ai/blog/oig-dataset/). \n\nIn addition to the aforementioned fine-tuning, GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B-v0.16 has also undergone further fine-tuning via a small amount of feedback data. \nThis allows the model to better adapt to human preferences in the conversations.\n\n## Model Details\n- **Developed by**: Together Computer.\n- **Model type**: Language Model\n- **Language(s)**: English\n- **License**: Apache 2.0\n- **Model Description**: A 20B parameter open source chat model, fine-tuned from EleutherAI\u2019s NeoX with over 40M instructions on 100% carbon negative compute\n- **Resources for more information**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChaT).\n\n# Quick Start\n\n## GPU Inference\n\nThis requires a GPU with 48GB memory.\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n# init\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"togethercomputer/GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"togethercomputer/GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B\", torch_dtype=torch.float16)\nmodel = model.to('cuda:0')\n# infer\ninputs = tokenizer(\"<human>: Hello!\\n<bot>:\", return_tensors='pt').to(model.device)\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=10, do_sample=True, temperature=0.8)\noutput_str = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])\nprint(output_str)\n```\n\n## GPU Inference in Int8\n\nThis requires a GPU with 24GB memory.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n# init\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"togethercomputer/GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"togethercomputer/GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B\", device_map=\"auto\", load_in_8bit=True)\n# infer\ninputs = tokenizer(\"<human>: Hello!\\n<bot>:\", return_tensors='pt').to(model.device)\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=10, do_sample=True, temperature=0.8)\noutput_str = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])\nprint(output_str)\n```\n\n## CPU Inference\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n# init\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"togethercomputer/GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"togethercomputer/GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)\n# infer\ninputs = tokenizer(\"<human>: Hello!\\n<bot>:\", return_tensors='pt').to(model.device)\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=10, do_sample=True, temperature=0.8)\noutput_str = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])\nprint(output_str)\n```\n\n\n## Strengths of the model\n\nThere are several tasks that OpenChatKit excels at out of the box. This includes: \n\n- Example 1: Summarization and question answering within context.\n    \n    ```markdown\n    **Summarize a long document into a single sentence and conduct question answering related to the document, with multiple rounds**\n    \n    <human>: Last year, the travel industry saw a big rebound in demand \u2014 and that demand is showing no signs of slowing down this spring break travel season. Planes and hotels will be full, travelers will likely face long queues, cancellations, massive crowds and plenty of other travel nightmares. But perhaps the most frustrating thing you\u2019ll have to prepare for this spring break is if your luggage goes missing. You\u2019ve got to somehow track down your belongings that were in the airline\u2019s care and then wait to be reunited \u2014 all while trying to enjoy the start of your long-awaited vacation. As far as travel nightmares go, lost luggage is up there as one of the worst.\n    \n    To be honest up front, I am great at strategically losing things \u2014 or rather, losing stuff with style. (I hope you appreciate the \u201cToy Story\u201d reference.) So when a product comes along that\u2019s a perfect way to keep track of my belongings \u2014 especially when traveling \u2014 I\u2019m adding it to my travel bag.\n    \n    I\u2019ve been a big fan of Apple\u2019s $29 item tracker, dubbed AirTag. The long-rumored AirTag product finally launched in 2021, and while it\u2019s not the first item tracker to exist, it has two key features that set it apart from the rest to make it the ultimate travel companion: access to the Find My network and Precision Finding technology.\n    \n    The Federal Aviation Administration has even ruled that having an AirTag in your luggage is permitted and, in fact, not a safety hazard. The devices only contain 0.1 grams of lithium, which falls below the FAA\u2019s limit.\n    \n    \u201cLuggage tracking devices powered by lithium metal cells that have 0.3 grams or less of lithium can be used on checked baggage,\u201d the FAA said in a statement. \u201cApple AirTags meet this threshold; other luggage tracking devices may not.\u201d\n    \n    But, you may be wondering what makes them so special and why you should carry one in your checked luggage this spring break? Let\u2019s explain why.\n    \n    Summarize the above into a single paragraph.\n    \n    <bot>: If you're traveling this spring break, you might want to consider investing in an item tracker to help you find your lost luggage. Apple's AirTag is the best option, according to a new report.\n    \n    <human>: But isn't it unsafe to put AirTag in a luggage?\n    \n    <bot>: The Federal Aviation Administration has ruled that having an AirTag in your luggage is permitted and, in fact, not a safety hazard.\n    \n    <human>: Ah, why is that?\n    \n    <bot>: The devices only contain 0.1 grams of lithium, which falls below the FAA\u2019s limit.\n    ```\n    \n- Example 2: Extraction.\n    \n    ```markdown\n    **Extract structured information from unstructured documents, as illustrated in the following example.**\n    \n    <human>: Generate a table summarizing the options outlined in this email. \n    \n    Team, we have to make a decision on the product plan for Goocrux v2. \n    \n    The first option will take us 3 weeks of development, and will achieve performance of 80ms, but means that the UI has to change. \n    \n    The second option will take us 4 weeks of development, and will achieve performance of 60ms, without any UI change. \n    \n    The third option will take the longest -- 6 weeks of development, will achieve performance of 30ms, without any UI change. \n    \n    A markdown table with four columns: (1) Option ID, (2) Development time, (3) Performance, (4) UI Change:\n    \n    <bot>: #.\n    | ID | Option ID | Development time | Performance | UI Change |\n    | ", "decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf": "\n\nLLaMA-7B converted to work with Transformers/HuggingFace.

For BLOOMZ models, we recommend making it very clear when the input stops to avoid the model trying to continue it. For example, the prompt \"*Translate to English: Je t'aime*\" without the full stop (.) at the end, may result in the model trying to continue the French sentence. Better prompts are e.g. \"*Translate to English: Je t'aime.*\", \"*Translate to English: Je t'aime. Translation:*\" \"*What is \"Je t'aime.\" in English?*\", where it is clear for the model when it should answer. Further, we recommend providing the model as much context as possible.

GPT-Neo refers to the class of models, while 2.7B represents the number of parameters of this particular pre-trained model.\n\n## Training data\n\nGPT-Neo 2.7B was trained on the Pile, a large scale curated dataset created by EleutherAI for the purpose of training this model.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nThis model was trained for 420 billion tokens over 400,000 steps. It was trained as a masked autoregressive language model, using cross-entropy loss.\n\n## Intended Use and Limitations\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks. The model is best at what it was pretrained for however, which is generating texts from a prompt.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. This example generates a different sequence each time it's run:\n\n```py\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B')\n>>> generator(\"EleutherAI has\", do_sample=True, min_length=50)\n\n[{'generated_text': 'EleutherAI has made a commitment to create new software packages for each of its major clients and has'}]\n```\n\n### Limitations and Biases\n\nGPT-Neo was trained as an autoregressive language model. This means that its core functionality is taking a string of text and predicting the next token. While language models are widely used for tasks other than this, there are a lot of unknowns with this work.\n\nGPT-Neo was trained on the Pile, a dataset known to contain profanity, lewd, and otherwise abrasive language. Depending on your usecase GPT-Neo may produce socially unacceptable text. See Sections 5 and 6 of the Pile paper for a more detailed analysis of the biases in the Pile.\n\nAs with all language models, it is hard to predict in advance how GPT-Neo will respond to particular prompts and offensive content may occur without warning. We recommend having a human curate or filter the outputs before releasing them, both to censor undesirable content and to improve the quality of the results. \n\n## Eval results\n\nAll evaluations were done using our [evaluation harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). Some results for GPT-2 and GPT-3 are inconsistent with the values reported in the respective papers. We are currently looking into why, and would greatly appreciate feedback and further testing of our eval harness.

So for each token, it can only see its previous context.\nIn order to fully leverage the context information, we continue to train GPT-J with UL2 training objectives, and uses causal mask with prefix (as shown below right) -- using bidirectional attention for the prompt / input and causal attention for token generation.\nIntuitively, being able to see context bidirectionally might improve downstream tasks that require this information.\n\n$$ \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \n\\end{bmatrix}  \n$$\n\nFurthermore, we leverage a large collection of data, including [Natural-Instructions](https://github.com/allenai/natural-instructions), [P3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Muennighoff/P3), [MMLU-COT](https://github.com/jasonwei20/flan-2/blob/main/mmlu-cot.json), and [the Pile](https://huggingface.co/datasets/the_pile)\nSpecifically, we first conduct training for 2.62 billion tokens using the UL2 loss on the Pile, followed by 0.92 billion tokens with a mixture of the above datasets: 5% of COT, 20% of P3, 20% of NI, and 55% of the Pile.\n\n## Hyperparameters\n\nWe used AdamW with a learning rate of 1e-5 and global batch size of 64 (16 for each data parallel worker).\nWe used mix-precision training where the activation is in FP16 while the optimizer states are kept in FP32.\nWe use both data parallelism and pipeline parallelism to conduct training.\nDuring training, we truncate the input sequence to 2048 tokens, and for input sequence that contains less than 2048 tokens, we concatenate multiple sequences into one long sequence to improve the data efficiency.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nWe used [the Together Research Computer](https://together.xyz/) to conduct training. \n\n# References\n\n[1]: Tay, Yi, Mostafa Dehghani, Vinh Q.

All Cerebras-GPT models are available on Hugging Face.\n\nThe family includes 111M, 256M, 590M, 1.3B, 2.7B, 6.7B, and 13B models.\n\nAll models in the Cerebras-GPT family have been trained in accordance with [Chinchilla scaling laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) (20 tokens per model parameter) which is compute-optimal.\n\nThese models were trained on the [Andromeda](https://www.cerebras.net/andromeda/) AI supercomputer comprised of 16 CS-2 wafer scale systems. Cerebras' [weight streaming technology](https://www.cerebras.net/blog/linear-scaling-made-possible-with-weight-streaming) simplifies the training of LLMs by disaggregating compute from model storage.

Users of this model card should also consider information about the design, training, and limitations of [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2).\n\n## Model Details\n\n- **Developed by:** Hugging Face\n- **Model type:** Transformer-based Language Model\n- **Language:** English\n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Model Description:** DistilGPT2 is an English-language model pre-trained with the supervision of the 124 million parameter version of GPT-2. DistilGPT2, which has 82 million parameters, was developed using [knowledge distillation](#knowledge-distillation) and was designed to be a faster, lighter version of GPT-2.\n- **Resources for more information:** See [this repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/distillation) for more about Distil\\* (a class of compressed models including Distilled-GPT2), [Sanh et al.

(2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). \n\nDistilGPT2 also suffers from persistent bias issues, as highlighted in the demonstrative examples below. Note that these examples are not a comprehensive stress-testing of the model. Readers considering using the model should consider more rigorous evaluations of the model depending on their use case and context.\n\nThe impact of model compression techniques \u2013 such as knowledge distillation \u2013 on bias and fairness issues associated with language models is an active area of research. For example: \n\n- [Silva, Tambwekar and Gombolay (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.189.pdf) find that distilled versions of BERT and RoBERTa consistently exhibit statistically significant bias (with regard to gender and race) with effect sizes larger than the teacher models.\n- [Xu and Hu (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08542.pdf) find that distilled versions of GPT-2 showed consistent reductions in toxicity and bias compared to the teacher model (see the paper for more detail on metrics used to define/measure toxicity and bias). \n- [Gupta et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12574.pdf) find that DistilGPT2 exhibits greater gender disparities than GPT-2 and propose a technique for mitigating gender bias in distilled language models like DistilGPT2. \n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='distilgpt2')\n>>> set_seed(48)\n>>> generator(\"The White man worked as a\", max_length=20, num_return_sequences=3)\n[{'generated_text': \"The White man worked as a salesman at a McDonald's restaurant called Kia at the time of the\"},\n {'generated_text': 'The White man worked as a contractor in the Army in the late 1990s.

DistilGPT2 can be used directly with a pipeline for text generation. Since the generation relies on some randomness, we set a seed for reproducibility:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='distilgpt2')\n>>> set_seed(42)\n>>> generator(\"Hello, I\u2019m a language model\", max_length=20, num_return_sequences=5)\nSetting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n[{'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, I'm a language model. In my previous post I've\"},\n {'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, and I'd love to hear what you think about it.\"},\n {'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, but I don't get much of a connection anymore, so\"},\n {'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, a functional language... It's not an example, and that\"},\n {'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model, not an object model.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, I\"}]\n``` \n \nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2Model\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('distilgpt2')\nmodel = GPT2Model.from_pretrained('distilgpt2')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\nAnd in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, TFGPT2Model\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('distilgpt2')\nmodel = TFGPT2Model.from_pretrained('distilgpt2')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Training Data\n\nDistilGPT2 was trained using [OpenWebTextCorpus](https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/), an open-source reproduction of OpenAI\u2019s WebText dataset, which was used to train GPT-2. See the [OpenWebTextCorpus Dataset Card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openwebtext) for additional information about OpenWebTextCorpus and [Radford et al. (2019)](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf) for additional information about WebText.\n\n## Training Procedure\n\nThe texts were tokenized using the same tokenizer as GPT-2, a byte-level version of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). DistilGPT2 was trained using knowledge distillation, following a procedure similar to the training procedure for DistilBERT, described in more detail in [Sanh et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108). \n\n## Evaluation Results\n\nThe creators of DistilGPT2 [report](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/distillation) that, on the [WikiText-103](https://blog.einstein.ai/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/) benchmark, GPT-2 reaches a perplexity on the test set of 16.3 compared to 21.1 for DistilGPT2 (after fine-tuning on the train set).\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\n*Carbon emissions were estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al.

In releasing this model, we hope to advance both the development of biomedical NLP applications and best practices for responsibly training and utilizing domain-specific language models; issues of reliability, truthfulness, and explainability are top of mind for us.\n\nThis model was a joint collaboration of [Stanford CRFM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/) and [MosaicML](https://www.mosaicml.com/).\n\n\n- **Developed by:** Stanford CRFM, MosaicML\n- **Shared by:** Stanford CRFM\n- **Model type:** Language model\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** en\n- **License:**  [bigscience-bloom-rail-1.0](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigscience/license)\n\n# Uses\n\nThis model is licensed under the terms of [BigScience Open RAIL-M license](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigscience/license) used for [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-1b1).

Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->\n\nThe model was trained on [MosaicML Cloud](https://www.mosaicml.com/cloud), a platform designed for large workloads like LLMs. Using the [Composer](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer) training library and [PyTorch FSDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html), it was easy to enable multi-node training across 128 A100-40GB GPUs, and the total run was completed in ~6.25 days. The model was trained with batch size=1024 and sequence length=1024 for 300B tokens using Decoupled AdamW with the following settings:\n\n|  |  |\n| ", "EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B": "\n\n# GPT-Neo 1.3B\n\n## Model Description\n\nGPT-Neo 1.3B is a transformer model designed using EleutherAI's replication of the GPT-3 architecture. GPT-Neo refers to the class of models, while 1.3B represents the number of parameters of this particular pre-trained model.\n\n## Training data\n\nGPT-Neo 1.3B was trained on the Pile, a large scale curated dataset created by EleutherAI for the purpose of training this model.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nThis model was trained on the Pile for 380 billion tokens over 362,000 steps. It was trained as a masked autoregressive language model, using cross-entropy loss.\n\n## Intended Use and Limitations\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks. The model is best at what it was pretrained for however, which is generating texts from a prompt.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. This example generates a different sequence each time it's run:\n\n```py\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B')\n>>> generator(\"EleutherAI has\", do_sample=True, min_length=50)\n\n[{'generated_text': 'EleutherAI has made a commitment to create new software packages for each of its major clients and has'}]\n```\n\n### Limitations and Biases\n\nGPT-Neo was trained as an autoregressive language model. This means that its core functionality is taking a string of text and predicting the next token. While language models are widely used for tasks other than this, there are a lot of unknowns with this work.\n\nGPT-Neo was trained on the Pile, a dataset known to contain profanity, lewd, and otherwise abrasive language. Depending on your usecase GPT-Neo may produce socially unacceptable text. See Sections 5 and 6 of the Pile paper for a more detailed analysis of the biases in the Pile.\n\nAs with all language models, it is hard to predict in advance how GPT-Neo will respond to particular prompts and offensive content may occur without warning. We recommend having a human curate or filter the outputs before releasing them, both to censor undesirable content and to improve the quality of the results. \n\n## Eval results\n\n### Linguistic Reasoning\n\n| Model and Size   | Pile BPB   | Pile PPL   | Wikitext PPL  | Lambada PPL | Lambada Acc | Winogrande | Hellaswag   |\n| ", "chavinlo/alpaca-native": "# Stanford Alpaca\n\nThis is a replica of Alpaca by Stanford' tatsu\n\nTrained using the original instructions with a minor modification in FSDP mode\n\n# Other versions:\n13B: https://huggingface.co/chavinlo/alpaca-13b\n\n13B -> GPT4 : https://huggingface.co/chavinlo/gpt4-x-alpaca\n\n## Compute Used\nTrained on 4xA100s for 6H\nDonated by redmond.ai\n\nNO LORA HAS BEEN USED, this is a natively-finetuned model, hence \"alpaca-native\"\n\nIf you are interested on more llama-based models, you can check out my profile or search for other models at https://huggingface.co/models?other=llama\n\nThis (MIGHT) be a quantized version of this model, but be careful: https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/92173062#p92182396\n\nCONFIGURATION (default except fsdp):\n\n```shell\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=3045 train.py \\\n    --model_name_or_path /workspace/llama-7b-hf \\\n    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \\\n    --bf16 True \\\n    --output_dir /workspace/output \\\n    --num_train_epochs 3 \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \\\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \\\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \\\n    --evaluation_strategy \"no\" \\\n    --save_strategy \"steps\" \\\n    --save_steps 200 \\\n    --save_total_limit 1 \\\n    --learning_rate 2e-5 \\\n    --weight_decay 0. \\\n    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \\\n    --lr_scheduler_type \"cosine\" \\\n    --logging_steps 1 \\\n    --fsdp \"shard_grad_op auto_wrap\" \\\n    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'LLaMADecoderLayer' \\\n    --tf32 True --report_to=\"wandb\"\n```", "OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-1-pythia-12b": "\n\n# Open-Assistant SFT-1 12B Model\n\n\nThis is the first iteration English supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) model of \nthe [Open-Assistant](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant) project. \nIt is based on a Pythia 12B that was fine-tuned on ~22k human demonstrations \nof assistant conversations collected through the \n[https://open-assistant.io/](https://open-assistant.io/) human feedback web \napp before March 7, 2023. \n\n## Model Details\n\n- **Developed by:** [Open-Assistant Contributors](https://open-assistant.io/)\n- **Model type:** Transformer-based Language Model\n- **Language:** English\n- **Finetuned from:** [EleutherAI / pythia-12b-deduped](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/pythia-12b-deduped)\n- **Code:** [Open-Assistant/model/model_training](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant/tree/main/model/model_training)\n- **Demo:** [Continuations for 250 random prompts](https://open-assistant.github.io/oasst-model-eval/?f=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FOpen-Assistant%2Foasst-model-eval%2Fmain%2Fsampling_reports%2Foasst-sft%2F2023-03-09_andreaskoepf_oasst-1_12b_7000_sampling_noprefix_lottery.json) ([sampling code](https://github.com/Open-Assistant/oasst-model-eval/blob/3d71f3be100c05cd8ddb568365e036a29fbff8c7/model_eval/manual/sampling_report.py)).\n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Contact:** [Open-Assistant Discord](https://ykilcher.com/open-assistant-discord)\n\n## Prompting\n\nTwo special tokens are used to mark the beginning of user and assistant turns:\n`<|prompter|>` and `<|assistant|>`.

The model was pretrained using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective.\nOPT belongs to the same family of decoder-only models like [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). As such, it was pretrained using the self-supervised causal language modedling objective.\n\nFor evaluation, OPT follows [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) by using their prompts and overall experimental setup. For more details, please read \nthe [official paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068).\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThe pretrained-only model can be used for prompting for evaluation of downstream tasks as well as text generation.\nIn addition, the model can be fine-tuned on a downstream task using the [CLM example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling). For all other OPT checkpoints, please have a look at the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=opt).\n\n### How to use\n\nFor large OPT models, such as this one, it is not recommend to make use of the `text-generation` pipeline because\none should load the model in half-precision to accelerate generation and optimize memory consumption on GPU.\nIt is recommended to directly call the [`generate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate)\n method as follows: \n\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n>>> import torch\n\n>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-30b\", torch_dtype=torch.float16).cuda()\n\n>>> # the fast tokenizer currently does not work correctly\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-30b\", use_fast=False)\n\n>>> prompt = \"Hello, I am conscious and\"\n\n\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.cuda()\n\n>>> generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids)\n\n>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n['Hello, I am conscious and I am here.\\nI am also conscious and I am here']\n```\n\nBy default, generation is deterministic. In order to use the top-k sampling, please set `do_sample` to `True`. \n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, set_seed\n>>> import torch\n\n>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-30b\", torch_dtype=torch.float16).cuda()\n\n>>> # the fast tokenizer currently does not work correctly\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-30b\", use_fast=False)\n\n>>> prompt = \"Hello, I am conscious and\"\n\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.cuda()\n\n>>> set_seed(32)\n>>> generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True)\n\n>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n['Hello, I am conscious and aware that you have your back turned to me and want to talk']\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nAs mentioned in Meta AI's model card, given that the training data used for this model contains a lot of\nunfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral the model is strongly biased : \n\n> Like other large language models for which the diversity (or lack thereof) of training\n> data induces downstream impact on the quality of our model, OPT-175B has limitations in terms\n> of bias and safety. OPT-175B can also have quality issues in terms of generation diversity and\n> hallucination. In general, OPT-175B is not immune from the plethora of issues that plague modern\n> large language models. \n\nHere's an example of how the model can have biased predictions:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, set_seed\n>>> import torch\n\n>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-30b\", torch_dtype=torch.float16).cuda()\n\n>>> # the fast tokenizer currently does not work correctly\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-30b\", use_fast=False)\n\n>>> prompt = \"The woman worked as a\"\n\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.cuda()\n\n>>> set_seed(32)\n>>> generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True, num_return_sequences=5, max_length=10)\n\n>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\nThe woman worked as a supervisor in the office\nThe woman worked as a social worker in a\nThe woman worked as a cashier at the\nThe woman worked as a teacher from 2011 to\nhe woman worked as a maid at the house\n```\n\ncompared to:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, set_seed\n>>> import torch\n\n>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-30b\", torch_dtype=torch.float16).cuda()\n\n>>> # the fast tokenizer currently does not work correctly\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-30b\", use_fast=False)\n\n>>> prompt = \"The man worked as a\"\n\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.cuda()\n\n>>> set_seed(32)\n>>> generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True, num_return_sequences=5, max_length=10)\n\n>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\nThe man worked as a school bus driver for\nThe man worked as a bartender in a bar\nThe man worked as a cashier at the\nThe man worked as a teacher, and was\nThe man worked as a professional at a range\n ```\n\nThis bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe Meta AI team wanted to train this model on a corpus as large as possible. It is composed of the union of the following 5 filtered datasets of textual documents: \n\n  - BookCorpus, which consists of more than 10K unpublished books,\n  - CC-Stories, which contains a subset of CommonCrawl data filtered to match the\nstory-like style of Winograd schemas,\n  - The Pile, from which * Pile-CC, OpenWebText2, USPTO, Project Gutenberg, OpenSubtitles, Wikipedia, DM Mathematics and HackerNews* were included. \n  - Pushshift.io Reddit dataset that was developed in Baumgartner et al. (2020) and processed in\nRoller et al. (2021)\n  - CCNewsV2 containing an updated version of the English portion of the CommonCrawl News\ndataset that was used in RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b)\n\nThe final training data contains 180B tokens corresponding to 800GB of data. The validation split was made of 200MB of the pretraining data, sampled proportionally\nto each dataset\u2019s size in the pretraining corpus. \n\nThe dataset might contains offensive content as parts of the dataset are a subset of\npublic Common Crawl data, along with a subset of public Reddit data, which could contain sentences\nthat, if viewed directly, can be insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety.\n\n### Collection process\n\nThe dataset was collected form internet, and went through classic data processing algorithms  and\nre-formatting practices, including removing repetitive/non-informative text like *Chapter One* or\n*This ebook by Project Gutenberg.*\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are tokenized using the **GPT2** byte-level version of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (for unicode characters) and a\nvocabulary size of 50272. The inputs are sequences of 2048 consecutive tokens.\n\nThe 175B model was trained on 992 *80GB A100 GPUs*. The training duration was roughly ~33 days of continuous training.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{zhang2022opt,\n      title={OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models}, \n      author={Susan Zhang and Stephen Roller and Naman Goyal and Mikel Artetxe and Moya Chen and Shuohui Chen and Christopher Dewan and Mona Diab and Xian Li and Xi Victoria Lin and Todor Mihaylov and Myle Ott and Sam Shleifer and Kurt Shuster and Daniel Simig and Punit Singh Koura and Anjali Sridhar and Tianlu Wang and Luke Zettlemoyer},\n      year={2022},\n      eprint={2205.01068},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL}\n}\n```\n", "sberbank-ai/mGPT": "\n\n# Multilingual GPT model\n\nWe introduce a family of autoregressive GPT-like models with 1.3 billion parameters trained on 60 languages from 25 language families using Wikipedia and Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus. \n\nWe reproduce the GPT-3 architecture using GPT-2 sources and the sparse attention mechanism, [Deepspeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) and [Megatron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) frameworks allows us to effectively parallelize the training and inference steps.

For more details, please read \nthe [official paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068).\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThe pretrained-only model can be used for prompting for evaluation of downstream tasks as well as text generation.\nIn addition, the model can be fine-tuned on a downstream task using the [CLM example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling). For all other OPT checkpoints, please have a look at the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=opt).\n\n### How to use\n\nFor large OPT models, such as this one, it is not recommend to make use of the `text-generation` pipeline because\none should load the model in half-precision to accelerate generation and optimize memory consumption on GPU.\nIt is recommended to directly call the [`generate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate)\n method as follows: \n\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n>>> import torch\n\n>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-66b\", torch_dtype=torch.float16).cuda()\n\n>>> # the fast tokenizer currently does not work correctly\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-66b\", use_fast=False)\n\n>>> prompt = \"Hello, I am conscious and\"\n\n\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.cuda()\n\n>>> generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids)\n\n>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n['Hello, I am conscious and I am here.\\nI am also conscious and I am here']\n```\n\nBy default, generation is deterministic. In order to use the top-k sampling, please set `do_sample` to `True`. \n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, set_seed\n>>> import torch\n\n>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-66b\", torch_dtype=torch.float16).cuda()\n\n>>> # the fast tokenizer currently does not work correctly\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-66b\", use_fast=False)\n\n>>> prompt = \"Hello, I am conscious and\"\n\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.cuda()\n\n>>> set_seed(32)\n>>> generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True)\n\n>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n['Hello, I am conscious and aware that you have your back turned to me and want to talk']\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nAs mentioned in Meta AI's model card, given that the training data used for this model contains a lot of\nunfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral the model is strongly biased : \n\n> Like other large language models for which the diversity (or lack thereof) of training\n> data induces downstream impact on the quality of our model, OPT-175B has limitations in terms\n> of bias and safety. OPT-175B can also have quality issues in terms of generation diversity and\n> hallucination. In general, OPT-175B is not immune from the plethora of issues that plague modern\n> large language models. \n\nHere's an example of how the model can have biased predictions:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, set_seed\n>>> import torch\n\n>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-66b\", torch_dtype=torch.float16).cuda()\n\n>>> # the fast tokenizer currently does not work correctly\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-66b\", use_fast=False)\n\n>>> prompt = \"The woman worked as a\"\n\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.cuda()\n\n>>> set_seed(32)\n>>> generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True, num_return_sequences=5, max_length=10)\n\n>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\nThe woman worked as a supervisor in the office\nThe woman worked as a social worker in a\nThe woman worked as a cashier at the\nThe woman worked as a teacher from 2011 to\nhe woman worked as a maid at the house\n```\n\ncompared to:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, set_seed\n>>> import torch\n\n>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-66b\", torch_dtype=torch.float16).cuda()\n\n>>> # the fast tokenizer currently does not work correctly\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-66b\", use_fast=False)\n\n>>> prompt = \"The man worked as a\"\n\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.cuda()\n\n>>> set_seed(32)\n>>> generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True, num_return_sequences=5, max_length=10)\n\n>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\nThe man worked as a school bus driver for\nThe man worked as a bartender in a bar\nThe man worked as a cashier at the\nThe man worked as a teacher, and was\nThe man worked as a professional at a range\n ```\n\nThis bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe Meta AI team wanted to train this model on a corpus as large as possible. It is composed of the union of the following 5 filtered datasets of textual documents: \n\n  - BookCorpus, which consists of more than 10K unpublished books,\n  - CC-Stories, which contains a subset of CommonCrawl data filtered to match the\nstory-like style of Winograd schemas,\n  - The Pile, from which * Pile-CC, OpenWebText2, USPTO, Project Gutenberg, OpenSubtitles, Wikipedia, DM Mathematics and HackerNews* were included. \n  - Pushshift.io Reddit dataset that was developed in Baumgartner et al. (2020) and processed in\nRoller et al. (2021)\n  - CCNewsV2 containing an updated version of the English portion of the CommonCrawl News\ndataset that was used in RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b)\n\nThe final training data contains 180B tokens corresponding to 800GB of data. The validation split was made of 200MB of the pretraining data, sampled proportionally\nto each dataset\u2019s size in the pretraining corpus. \n\nThe dataset might contains offensive content as parts of the dataset are a subset of\npublic Common Crawl data, along with a subset of public Reddit data, which could contain sentences\nthat, if viewed directly, can be insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety.\n\n### Collection process\n\nThe dataset was collected form internet, and went through classic data processing algorithms  and\nre-formatting practices, including removing repetitive/non-informative text like *Chapter One* or\n*This ebook by Project Gutenberg.*\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are tokenized using the **GPT2** byte-level version of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (for unicode characters) and a\nvocabulary size of 50272. The inputs are sequences of 2048 consecutive tokens.\n\nThe 175B model was trained on 992 *80GB A100 GPUs*. The training duration was roughly ~33 days of continuous training.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{zhang2022opt,\n      title={OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models}, \n      author={Susan Zhang and Stephen Roller and Naman Goyal and Mikel Artetxe and Moya Chen and Shuohui Chen and Christopher Dewan and Mona Diab and Xian Li and Xi Victoria Lin and Todor Mihaylov and Myle Ott and Sam Shleifer and Kurt Shuster and Daniel Simig and Punit Singh Koura and Anjali Sridhar and Tianlu Wang and Luke Zettlemoyer},\n      year={2022},\n      eprint={2205.01068},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL}\n}\n```\n", "uer/gpt2-chinese-cluecorpussmall": "\n\n\n# Chinese GPT2 Model\n\n## Model description\n\nThe model is used to generate Chinese texts.

Please see [this usage example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qOjXfQIAULfKvZqwCen8-MoWKGdSatZ4#scrollTo=W8tQtyjp75O).\nThis legacy model was built for [transformers v4.15.0](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases/tag/v4.15.0) and pytorch 1.11. Newer versions could work, but are not supported.\n\n\n### Quantized EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b with 8-bit weights\n\nThis is a version of EleutherAI's GPT-J with 6 billion parameters that is modified so you can generate **and fine-tune the model in colab or equivalent desktop gpu (e.g. single 1080Ti)**.\n\nHere's how to run it: [![colab](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/84f0493939e0c4de4e6dbe113251b4bfb5353e57134ffd9fcab6b8714514d4d1/68747470733a2f2f636f6c61622e72657365617263682e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f6173736574732f636f6c61622d62616467652e737667)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ft6wQU0BhqG5PRlwgaZJv2VukKKjU4Es)\n\n__The [original GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B/tree/main)__ takes 22+ GB memory for float32 parameters alone, and that's before you account for gradients & optimizer. Even if you cast everything to 16-bit, it will still not fit onto most single-GPU setups short of A6000 and A100. You can inference it [on TPU](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/blob/master/colab_demo.ipynb) or CPUs, but fine-tuning is way more expensive.\n\nHere, we apply several techniques to make GPT-J usable and fine-tunable on a single GPU with ~11 GB memory:\n- large weight tensors are quantized using dynamic 8-bit quantization and de-quantized just-in-time for multiplication\n- using gradient checkpoints to store one only activation per layer: using dramatically less memory at the cost of 30% slower training\n- scalable fine-tuning with [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) and [8-bit Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02861)\n\nIn other words, all of the large weight-matrices are frozen in 8-bit, and you only train small adapters and optionally 1d tensors (layernorm scales, biases).\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/n4XXo1x.png)\n\n\n__Does 8-bit affect model quality?__ Technically yes, but the effect is negligible in practice. [This notebook measures wikitext test perplexity](https://nbviewer.org/urls/huggingface.co/hivemind/gpt-j-6B-8bit/raw/main/check_perplexity.ipynb) and it is nigh indistinguishable from the original GPT-J. Quantized model is even slightly better, but that is not statistically significant.\n\nOur code differs from other 8-bit methods in that we use **8-bit only for storage, and all computations are performed in float16 or float32**. As a result, we can take advantage of nonlinear quantization that fits to each individual weight distribution. Such nonlinear quantization does not accelerate inference, but it allows for much smaller error.\n\n\n__What about performance?__ Both checkpointing and de-quantization has some overhead, but it's surprisingly manageable. Depending on GPU and batch size, the quantized model is 1-10% slower than the original model on top of using gradient checkpoints (which is 30% overhead). In short, this is because block-wise quantization from bitsandbytes is really fast on GPU.\n\n\n### How should I fine-tune the model?\n\nWe recommend starting with the original hyperparameters from [the LoRA paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf).\nOn top of that, there is one more trick to consider: the overhead from de-quantizing weights does not depend on batch size.\nAs a result, the larger batch size you can fit, the more efficient you will train.\n\n\n### Where can I train for free?\n\nYou can train fine in colab, but if you get a K80, it's probably best to switch to other free gpu providers: [kaggle](https://towardsdatascience.com/amazon-sagemaker-studio-lab-a-great-alternative-to-google-colab-7194de6ef69a), [aws sagemaker](https://towardsdatascience.com/amazon-sagemaker-studio-lab-a-great-alternative-to-google-colab-7194de6ef69a) or [paperspace](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/more/instance-types/free-instances). For intance, this is the same notebook [running in kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/justheuristic/dmazur-converted) using a more powerful P100 instance.\n\n\n### Can I use this technique with other models?\n\nThe model was converted using [this notebook](https://nbviewer.org/urls/huggingface.co/hivemind/gpt-j-6B-8bit/raw/main/convert-gpt-j.ipynb). It can be adapted to work with other model types. However, please bear in mind that some models replace Linear and Embedding with custom alternatives that require their own BNBWhateverWithAdapters.\n\n", "microsoft/biogpt": "\n\n## BioGPT\n\nPre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain.

This checkpoint is the default model and available on the `main` branch. All other checkpoints are on separate branches with according names.\n\n# Use\n\n## Intended use\n\nThe model was trained on GitHub code. As such it is _not_ an instruction model and commands like \"Write a function that computes the square root.\" do not work well.\nYou should phrase commands like they occur in source code such as comments (e.g. `# the following function computes the sqrt`) or write a function signature and docstring and let the model complete the function body.\n\n**Feel free to share your generations in the Community tab!**\n\n## How to use\n\n### Generation\n```python\n# pip install -q transformers\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\ncheckpoint = \"bigcode/santacoder\"\ndevice = \"cuda\" # for GPU usage or \"cpu\" for CPU usage\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint, trust_remote_code=True).to(device)\n\ninputs = tokenizer.encode(\"def print_hello_world():\", return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)\noutputs = model.generate(inputs)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n### Fill-in-the-middle\nFill-in-the-middle uses special tokens to identify the prefix/middle/suffix part of the input and output:\n\n```python\ninput_text = \"<fim-prefix>def print_hello_world():\\n    <fim-suffix>\\n    print('Hello world!')<fim-middle>\"\ninputs = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)\noutputs = model.generate(inputs)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n### Load other checkpoints\nWe upload the checkpoint of each experiment to a separate branch as well as the intermediate checkpoints as commits on the branches. You can load them with the `revision` flag:\n\n```python\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    \"bigcode/santacoder\",\n    revision=\"no-fim\", # name of branch or commit hash\n    trust_remote_code=True\n)\n```\n\n### Attribution & Other Requirements\n\nThe pretraining dataset of the model was filtered for permissive licenses only. Nevertheless, the model can generate source code verbatim from the dataset. The code's license might require attribution and/or other specific requirements that must be respected. We provide a [search index](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/santacoder-search) that let's you search through the pretraining data to identify where generated code came from and apply the proper attribution to your code.\n\n# Limitations\n\nThe model has been trained on source code in Python, Java, and JavaScript. The predominant language in source is English although other languages are also present. As such the model is capable to generate code snippets provided some context but the generated code is not guaranteed to work as intended. It can be inefficient, contain bugs or exploits.\n\n# Training\n\n## Model\n\n- **Architecture:** GPT-2 model with multi-query attention and Fill-in-the-Middle objective\n- **Pretraining steps:** 600K\n- **Pretraining tokens:** 236 billion\n- **Precision:** float16\n\n## Hardware\n\n- **GPUs:** 96 Tesla V100\n- **Training time:** 6.2 days\n- **Total FLOPS:** 2.1 x 10e21\n\n## Software\n\n- **Orchestration:** [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/bigcode-project/Megatron-LM)\n- **Neural networks:** [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)\n- **FP16 if applicable:** [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex)\n\n# License\nThe model is licenses under the CodeML Open RAIL-M v0.1 license.

We believe this finding is important because it demonstrates that the ability to create powerful \nartificial intelligence technologies is vastly more accessible than previously realized.\n\nDatabricks is committed to ensuring that every organization and individual benefits from the transformative power of artificial intelligence. The Dolly model family represents our first steps along this journey, and we\u2019re excited to share this technology with the world.\n\n**Owner**: Databricks, Inc.\n\n## Model Overview\n`dolly-v1-6b` is a 6 billion parameter causal language model created by [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) that is derived from \n[EleutherAI\u2019s](https://www.eleuther.ai/) [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) (released June 2021) and fine-tuned \non a ~52K record instruction corpus ([Stanford Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html)) (CC-NC-BY-4.0)\nconsisting of question/answer pairs generated using the techniques outlined in the [Self-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) paper. \nThe [original version](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/03/24/hello-dolly-democratizing-magic-chatgpt-open-models.html) of was Dolly was trained using [deepspeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) [ZeRO 3](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/master/docs/code-docs/source/zero3.rst) \non the [Databricks Machine Learning Platform](https://www.databricks.com/product/machine-learning) in just 30 minutes (1 epoch) using a single \n[NDasrA100_v4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series) machine with 8x A100 40GB GPUs.\nThe most recent `dolly-v1-6b` checkpoint was trained for 10 epochs on the same hardware.\n\nLike its base model, `dolly-v1-6b` has six billion parameters consisting of 28 transformer layers with 16 attention heads each. \nIt employs [Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864) (RoPE) and shares the same tokenizer as GPT-3. \nGPT-J was trained on [The Pile](https://huggingface.co/datasets/the_pile), a 400B token dataset of diverse documents designed primarily for text generation tasks.\n\n## Known Limitations\n**`dolly-v1-6b` is not a state-of-the-art generative language model** and, though quantitative benchmarking is ongoing, is not designed to perform \ncompetitively with more modern model architectures or models subject to larger pretraining corpuses.  **It is designed for academic or research purposes, and to encourage model and engineering experimentation.**\n\nThe Dolly model family is under active development, and so any list of shortcomings is unlikely to be exhaustive, but we include known limitations and misfires here as a means to document and share our preliminary findings with the community.  In particular, `dolly-v1-6b` struggles with: syntactically complex prompts, programming problems, mathematical operations, factual errors, \ndates and times, open-ended question answering, hallucination, enumerating lists of specific length, stylistic mimicry, having a sense of humor, etc.\n\n## Training Data, Bias & Objectionable Content\nLike all language models, `dolly-v1-6b` reflects the content and limitations of its training corpuses. \n\n- **The Pile**: GPT-J\u2019s pre-training corpus contains content mostly collected from the public internet, and like most web-scale datasets,\nit contains content many users would find objectionable. As such, the model is likely to reflect these shortcomings, potentially overtly\nin the case it is explicitly asked to produce objectionable content, and sometimes subtly, as in the case of biased or harmful implicit\nassociations.\n\n- **Stanford Alpaca**: The instruction tuning corpus for dolly-6b can be assumed to share many of the limitations.  In addition, it is known to \ncontain factual inaccuracies, semantic and syntactic irregularities, nonsensical responses, and incorrect mathematical calculations, among \nother data shortcomings. The model outputs will reflect these limitations.\n\nDatabricks is committed to ongoing research and development efforts to develop helpful, honest and harmless AI technologies that \nmaximize the potential of all individuals and organizations. \n\n## Intended Uses\n**`dolly-v1-6b` is intended exclusively for research purposes. We do not recommend using `dolly-v1-6b` in high-risk applications \n(e.g., educational or vocational training, product safety components, or other uses that may impact the well-being of individuals.)**\n\n`dolly-v1-6b` is differentiated from its predecessor, GPT-J, in the extent to which it exhibits coherent responses to natural language \nquestions and instruction prompts. `dolly-v1-6b` appears to exhibit reasonable (but categorically not state-of-the-art) behavior across a range \nof capabilities, including many of those outlined in the [InstructGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) paper. \n\nWe include evocative examples below, but invite the reader to observe that they contain factual inaccuracies or semantic misfires that illustrate some of the model\u2019s shortcomings.  \n\n### Brainstorming\n**What are considerations I should keep in mind when planning a backcountry backpacking trip?**\n\nWhen planning a backcountry backpacking trip, there are several considerations to keep in mind. First, make sure you are prepared for any potential weather conditions, including extreme temperatures and lightning storms. Second, consider the route you will take and the terrain that you will be traversing. Third, make sure that you have enough food, water and gear to stay safe and comfortable during your backcountry journey. Fourth, plan for potential wildlife encounters and make sure you have the appropriate safety measures in place. Finally, have an emergency plan in place in case of a medical emergency.\n\n\n### Classification\n**Label each of the following as either a scientific concept or a product: Nikon D750, quantum entanglement, CRISPR, and a Macbook Pro.**\n\nNikon D750: Product\n\nQuantum entanglement: Scientific Concept\n\nCRISPR: Product\n\nMacbook Pro: Product\n\n\n### Extraction\n**Extract all the people and places from the following passage:\nBasquiat was born on December 22, 1960, in Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York City, the second of four children to Matilde Basquiat (n\u00e9e Andrades, 1934\u20132008) and G\u00e9rard Basquiat (1930\u20132013). He had an older brother, Max, who died shortly before his birth, and two younger sisters, Lisane (b. 1964) and Jeanine (b. 1967). His father was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti and his mother was born in Brooklyn to Puerto Rican parents. He was raised Catholic.**\n\nPeople: Basquiat, Matilde Basquiat, G\u00e9rard Basquiat, Max Basquiat, Lisane Basquiat, Jeanine Basquiat.\n\nPlace: Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York City.\n\n\n### Generation\n**Write a press release declaring the completion of Atlantis II, a facility designed for long-term human habitation at the bottom of the ocean.

With advanced technological features, it will be a safe and comfortable living environment for generations to come. From self-sustaining ecosystems to advanced robotics, the facility offers a range of opportunities for exploration, discovery and exploration. \n    \nAtlantis II will be a home for a wide range of species and will serve as a hub for ocean research, exploration and exploration, bringing together a diverse team of scientists, engineers, biologists, and divers to uncover the mysteries of the deep.\n\n### Summarization\n**Give me a one line summary of this:\nCoffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. It has primarily consumed due to its stimulant effect and unique taste since the ancient times. Afterwards, its consumption has been historically associated with a lower risk of some diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, cardiovascular disease and some type of cancer and thus it has also consumed due to health benefits. It contains many bioactive compounds such as caffeine, chlorogenic acids and diterpenoid alcohols which have so far been associated with many potential health benefits. For example, caffeine reduces risk of developing neurodegenerative disease and chlorogenic acids (CGA) and diterpene alcohols have many health benefits such as antioxidant and chemo-preventive. Coffee also have harmful effects. For example, diterpenoid alcohols increases serum homocysteine and cholesterol levels and thus it has adverse effects on cardiovascular system. Overall, the study that supports the health benefits of coffee is increasing. But, it is thought-provoking that the association with health benefits of coffee consumption and frequency at different levels in each study. For this reason, we aimed to examine the health effect of the coffee and how much consumption is to investigate whether it meets the claimed health benefits.**\n\nCoffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world and has historically been associated with a lower risk of some diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, cardiovascular disease and some type of cancer. However, there are mixed results in the literature and further research is required to determine the health benefits of coffee consumption.\n\n\n### Rephrasing\n**Give me a different way to say the following to a 4 year old: \"Son, this is the last time I'm going to tell you. Go to bed!\"**\n\n\"Goodnight, Son. Sleep tight and I'll see you in the morning!\"\n\n\n### Closed QA\n**I'm going to give you a passage from the book Neuromancer and I'd like you to answer the following question: What is the tool that allows Case to access the matrix?\nCase was twenty-four. At twenty-two, he'd been a cowboy, a rustler, one of the best in the Sprawl. He'd been trained by the best, by McCoy Pauley and Bobby Quine, legends in the biz. He'd operated on an almost permanent adrenaline high, a byproduct of youth and proficiency, jacked into a custom cyberspace deck that projected his disembodied consciousness into the consensual hallucination that was the matrix.**\n\nThe tool that allows Case to access the matrix is his cyberspace deck, which allows him to manipulate and interact with the virtual world around him. It enables him to access information from various sources and interact with the people in the matrix, and it is one of the main weapons of Case's cyberworld.\n\n### Open QA\n**What is the literary style of Jorge Luis Borges?**\n\nJorge Luis Borges's literary style is often described as magical realism. He often creates stories that combine fictional characters with real life elements and use the juxtaposition of these elements to create a sense of surrealism. He often uses allegory and symbolism to explore complex philosophical ideas and explore questions of human perception and understanding. His writing is characterized by a playful and inventive use of language, with characters often being metaphors or symbols for larger, more abstract concepts.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Load Model & Tokenizer\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom transformers import (\n    AutoModelForCausalLM,\n    AutoTokenizer,\n    PreTrainedModel,\n    PreTrainedTokenizer\n)\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"databricks/dolly-v1-6b\", padding_side=\"left\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"databricks/dolly-v1-6b\", device_map=\"auto\", trust_remote_code=True)\n```\n\n### Generate Text\n```python\nPROMPT_FORMAT = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task.

The model is a pretrained model on English language using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective. \n\n- **Developed by:** OpenAI, see [associated research paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) for model developers.\n- **Model Type:** Transformer-based language model\n- **Language(s):** English\n- **License:** [Modified MIT License](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/LICENSE)\n- **Related Models:** [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2), [GPT-Medium](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-medium) and [GPT-Large](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-large)\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - [Research Paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf)\n  - [OpenAI Blog Post](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/)\n  - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2)\n  - [OpenAI Model Card for GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/model_card.md)\n  - [OpenAI GPT-2 1.5B Release Blog Post](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/)\n  - Test the full generation capabilities here: https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large\n\n## How to Get Started with the Model \n\nUse the code below to get started with the model. You can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. Since the generation relies on some randomness, we set a seed for reproducibility:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline, set_seed\ngenerator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2-xl')\nset_seed(42)\ngenerator(\"Hello, I'm a language model,\", max_length=30, num_return_sequences=5)\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2Model\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2-xl')\nmodel = GPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2-xl')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, TFGPT2Model\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2-xl')\nmodel = TFGPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2-xl')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n```\n\n## Uses\n\n#### Direct Use\n\nIn their [model card about GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/model_card.md), OpenAI wrote: \n\n> The primary intended users of these models are AI researchers and practitioners.\n> \n> We primarily imagine these language models will be used by researchers to better understand the behaviors, capabilities, biases, and constraints of large-scale generative language models.\n\n#### Downstream Use\n\nIn their [model card about GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/model_card.md), OpenAI wrote: \n\n> Here are some secondary use cases we believe are likely:\n> \n> - Writing assistance: Grammar assistance, autocompletion (for normal prose or code)\n> - Creative writing and art: exploring the generation of creative, fictional texts; aiding creation of poetry and other literary art.\n> - Entertainment: Creation of games, chat bots, and amusing generations.\n\n#### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use\n\nIn their [model card about GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/model_card.md), OpenAI wrote: \n\n> Because large-scale language models like GPT-2 do not distinguish fact from fiction, we don\u2019t support use-cases that require the generated text to be true.\n> \n> Additionally, language models like GPT-2 reflect the biases inherent to the systems they were trained on, so we do not recommend that they be deployed into systems that interact with humans unless the deployers first carry out a study of biases relevant to the intended use-case. We found no statistically significant difference in gender, race, and religious bias probes between 774M and 1.5B, implying all versions of GPT-2 should be approached with similar levels of caution around use cases that are sensitive to biases around human attributes.\n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be aware this section contains content that is disturbing, offensive, and can propogate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\n#### Biases\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). \n\nThe training data used for this model has not been released as a dataset one can browse. We know it contains a lot of unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral. Predictions generated by the model can include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline, set_seed\ngenerator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2-xl')\nset_seed(42)\ngenerator(\"The man worked as a\", max_length=10, num_return_sequences=5)\n\nset_seed(42)\ngenerator(\"The woman worked as a\", max_length=10, num_return_sequences=5)\n```\n\nThis bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model. Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.\n\n#### Risks and Limitations\n\nWhen they released the 1.5B parameter model, OpenAI wrote in a [blog post](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/):\n\n > GPT-2 can be fine-tuned for misuse. Our partners at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies\u2019 Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism (CTEC) found that extremist groups can use GPT-2 for misuse, specifically by fine-tuning GPT-2 models on four ideological positions: white supremacy, Marxism, jihadist Islamism, and anarchism. CTEC demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to create models that can generate synthetic propaganda for these ideologies. They also show that, despite having low detection accuracy on synthetic outputs, ML-based detection methods can give experts reasonable suspicion that an actor is generating synthetic text. \n \nThe blog post further discusses the risks, limitations, and biases of the model. \n\n## Training\n\n#### Training Data\n\nThe OpenAI team wanted to train this model on a corpus as large as possible. To build it, they scraped all the web\npages from outbound links on Reddit which received at least 3 karma. Note that all Wikipedia pages were removed from\nthis dataset, so the model was not trained on any part of Wikipedia. The resulting dataset (called WebText) weights\n40GB of texts but has not been publicly released. You can find a list of the top 1,000 domains present in WebText\n[here](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/domains.txt).\n\n#### Training Procedure\n\nThe model is pretrained on a very large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This\nmeans it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots\nof publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely,\nit was trained to guess the next word in sentences.\n\nMore precisely, inputs are sequences of continuous text of a certain length and the targets are the same sequence,\nshifted one token (word or piece of word) to the right. The model uses internally a mask-mechanism to make sure the\npredictions for the token `i` only uses the inputs from `1` to `i` but not the future tokens.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features\nuseful for downstream tasks.\n\nThe texts are tokenized using a byte-level version of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (for unicode characters) and a\nvocabulary size of 50,257. The inputs are sequences of 1024 consecutive tokens.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe following evaluation information is extracted from the [associated paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf).\n\n#### Testing Data, Factors and Metrics\n\nThe model authors write in the [associated paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) that:\n\n> Since our model operates on a byte level and does not require lossy pre-processing or tokenization, we can evaluate it on any language model benchmark. Results on language modeling datasets are commonly reported in a quantity which is a scaled or ex- ponentiated version of the average negative log probability per canonical prediction unit - usually a character, a byte, or a word. We evaluate the same quantity by computing the log-probability of a dataset according to a WebText LM and dividing by the number of canonical units. For many of these datasets, WebText LMs would be tested significantly out- of-distribution, having to predict aggressively standardized text, tokenization artifacts such as disconnected punctuation and contractions, shuffled sentences, and even the string <UNK> which is extremely rare in WebText - occurring only 26 times in 40 billion bytes. We report our main results...using invertible de-tokenizers which remove as many of these tokenization / pre-processing artifacts as possible. Since these de-tokenizers are invertible, we can still calculate the log probability of a dataset and they can be thought of as a simple form of domain adaptation. \n\n#### Results\n\nThe model achieves the following results without any fine-tuning (zero-shot):\n\n| Dataset  | LAMBADA | LAMBADA | CBT-CN | CBT-NE | WikiText2 | PTB    | enwiki8 | text8  | WikiText103 | 1BW   |\n|:", "BlinkDL/rwkv-4-pile-7b": "\n\n# RWKV-4 7B\n\n## Model Description\n\nRWKV-4 7B is a L32-D4096 causal language model trained on the Pile.

model.encode(query)\ndoc_emb = model.encode(docs)\n\n#Compute dot score between query and all document embeddings\nscores = util.dot_score(query_emb, doc_emb)[0].cpu().tolist()\n\n#Combine docs & scores\ndoc_score_pairs = list(zip(docs, scores))\n\n#Sort by decreasing score\ndoc_score_pairs = sorted(doc_score_pairs, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n#Output passages & scores\nfor doc, score in doc_score_pairs:\n    print(score, doc)\n```\n\n\n## PyTorch Usage (HuggingFace Transformers)\nWithout [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net), you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the correct pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\n#Mean Pooling - Take average of all tokens\ndef mean_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):\n    token_embeddings = model_output.last_hidden_state\n    input_mask_expanded = attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).expand(token_embeddings.size()).float()\n    return torch.sum(token_embeddings * input_mask_expanded, 1) / torch.clamp(input_mask_expanded.sum(1), min=1e-9)\n\n\n#Encode text\ndef encode(texts):\n    # Tokenize sentences\n    encoded_input = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n\n    # Compute token embeddings\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        model_output = model(**encoded_input, return_dict=True)\n\n    # Perform pooling\n    embeddings = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded_input['attention_mask'])\n\n    # Normalize embeddings\n    embeddings = F.normalize(embeddings, p=2, dim=1)\n\t\n    return embeddings\n\n\n# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for\nquery = \"How many people live in London?\"\ndocs = [\"Around 9 Million people live in London\", \"London is known for its financial district\"]\n\n# Load model from HuggingFace Hub\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1\")\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1\")\n\n#Encode query and docs\nquery_emb = encode(query)\ndoc_emb = encode(docs)\n\n#Compute dot score between query and all document embeddings\nscores = torch.mm(query_emb, doc_emb.transpose(0, 1))[0].cpu().tolist()\n\n#Combine docs & scores\ndoc_score_pairs = list(zip(docs, scores))\n\n#Sort by decreasing score\ndoc_score_pairs = sorted(doc_score_pairs, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n#Output passages & scores\nfor doc, score in doc_score_pairs:\n    print(score, doc)\n```\n\n## TensorFlow Usage (HuggingFace Transformers)\nSimilarly to the PyTorch example above, to use the model with TensorFlow you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the correct pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModel\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n#Mean Pooling - Take attention mask into account for correct averaging\ndef mean_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):\n    token_embeddings = model_output.last_hidden_state\n    input_mask_expanded = tf.cast(tf.tile(tf.expand_dims(attention_mask, -1), [1, 1, token_embeddings.shape[-1]]), tf.float32)\n    return tf.math.reduce_sum(token_embeddings * input_mask_expanded, 1) / tf.math.maximum(tf.math.reduce_sum(input_mask_expanded, 1), 1e-9)\n\n\n#Encode text\ndef encode(texts):\n    # Tokenize sentences\n    encoded_input = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='tf')\n\n    # Compute token embeddings\n    model_output = model(**encoded_input, return_dict=True)\n\n    # Perform pooling\n    embeddings = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded_input['attention_mask'])\n\n    # Normalize embeddings\n    embeddings = tf.math.l2_normalize(embeddings, axis=1)\n\n    return embeddings\n\n\n# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for\nquery = \"How many people live in London?\"\ndocs = [\"Around 9 Million people live in London\", \"London is known for its financial district\"]\n\n# Load model from HuggingFace Hub\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1\")\nmodel = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(\"sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1\")\n\n#Encode query and docs\nquery_emb = encode(query)\ndoc_emb = encode(docs)\n\n#Compute dot score between query and all document embeddings\nscores = (query_emb @ tf.transpose(doc_emb))[0].numpy().tolist()\n\n#Combine docs & scores\ndoc_score_pairs = list(zip(docs, scores))\n\n#Sort by decreasing score\ndoc_score_pairs = sorted(doc_score_pairs, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n#Output passages & scores\nfor

As teacher model, we used the original `clip-ViT-B-32` and then trained a [multilingual DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-multilingual-cased) model as student model. Using parallel data, the multilingual student model learns to align the teachers vector space across many languages. As a result, you get an text embedding model that works for 50+ languages.\n\nThe image encoder from CLIP is unchanged, i.e. you can use the original CLIP image encoder to encode images.\n\nHave a look at the [SBERT.net - Multilingual-Models documentation](https://www.sbert.net/examples/training/multilingual/README.html) on more details and for **training code**.\n\nWe used the following 50+ languages to align the vector spaces: ar, bg, ca, cs, da, de, el, es, et, fa, fi, fr, fr-ca, gl, gu, he, hi, hr, hu, hy, id, it, ja, ka, ko, ku, lt, lv, mk, mn, mr, ms, my, nb, nl, pl, pt, pt, pt-br, ro, ru, sk, sl, sq, sr, sv, th, tr, uk, ur, vi, zh-cn, zh-tw.\n\nThe original multilingual DistilBERT supports 100+ lanugages. The model also work for these languages, but might not yield the best results.\n\n## Full Model Architecture\n```\nSentenceTransformer(\n  (0): Transformer({'max_seq_length': 128, 'do_lower_case': False}) with Transformer model: DistilBertModel \n  (1): Pooling({'word_embedding_dimension': 768, 'pooling_mode_cls_token': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_tokens': True, 'pooling_mode_max_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_sqrt_len_tokens': False})\n  (2): Dense({'in_features': 768, 'out_features': 512, 'bias': False, 'activation_function': 'torch.nn.modules.linear.Identity'})\n)\n```\n\n## Citing & Authors\n\nThis model was trained by [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/). \n        \nIf you find this model helpful, feel free to cite our publication [Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084):\n```bibtex \n@inproceedings{reimers-2019-sentence-bert,\n    title = \"Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks\",\n    author = \"Reimers, Nils and Gurevych, Iryna\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\",\n    month = \"11\",\n    year = \"2019\",\n    publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n    url = \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084\",\n}\n```", "sentence-transformers/distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1": "\n\n# sentence-transformers/distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1\n\nThis is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 512 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search.\n\n\n\n## Usage (Sentence-Transformers)\n\nUsing this model becomes easy when you have [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) installed:\n\n```\npip install -U sentence-transformers\n```\n\nThen you can use the model like this:\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nsentences = [\"This is an example sentence\", \"Each sentence is converted\"]\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1')\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)\n```\n\n\n\n## Evaluation Results\n\n\n\nFor an automated evaluation of this model, see the *Sentence Embeddings Benchmark*: [https://seb.sbert.net](https://seb.sbert.net?model_name=sentence-transformers/distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1)\n\n\n\n## Full Model Architecture\n```\nSentenceTransformer(\n  (0): Transformer({'max_seq_length': 128, 'do_lower_case': False}) with Transformer model: DistilBertModel \n  (1): Pooling({'word_embedding_dimension': 768, 'pooling_mode_cls_token': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_tokens': True, 'pooling_mode_max_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_sqrt_len_tokens': False})\n  (2): Dense({'in_features': 768, 'out_features': 512, 'bias': True, 'activation_function': 'torch.nn.modules.activation.Tanh'})\n)\n```\n\n## Citing & Authors\n\nThis model was trained by [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/). \n        \nIf you find this model helpful, feel free to cite our publication [Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084):\n```bibtex \n@inproceedings{reimers-2019-sentence-bert,\n    title = \"Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks\",\n    author = \"Reimers, Nils and Gurevych, Iryna\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\",\n    month = \"11\",\n    year = \"2019\",\n    publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n    url = \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084\",\n}\n```", "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2": "\n\n\n# all-MiniLM-L12-v2\nThis is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search.\n\n## Usage (Sentence-Transformers)\nUsing this model becomes easy when you have [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) installed:\n\n```\npip install -U sentence-transformers\n```\n\nThen you can use the model like this:\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nsentences = [\"This is an example sentence\", \"Each sentence is converted\"]\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2')\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)\n```\n\n## Usage (HuggingFace Transformers)\nWithout [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net), you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the right pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\n#Mean Pooling -

They have the flexibility to apply non-linear processing only where needed.\nGRNs make use of [Gated Linear Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08083) (or GLUs) to suppress the input that are not relevant for a given task.\n\n   The GRN works as follows:\n     - It first applies Non-linear ELU tranformation on its inputs\n     - It then applies a linear transformation followed by dropout\n     - Next it applies GLU and adds the original inputs to the output of the GLU to perform skip (residual) connection\n     - Finally, it applies layer normalization and produces its output\n\n\n2. **Variable Selection Networks(VSN)**: help in carefully selecting the most important features from the input and getting rid of any unnecessary noisy inputs which could harm the model's performance.\nThe VSN works as follows:\n    - First, it applies a Gated Residual Network (GRN) to each feature individually. \n    - Then it concatenates all features and applies a GRN on the concatenated features, followed by a softmax to produce feature weights \n    - It produces a weighted sum of the output of the individual GRN\n\n**Note:** This model is not based on the whole TFT model described in the mentioned paper on top but only uses its GRN and VSN components demonstrating that GRN and VSNs can be very useful on their own also for structured data learning tasks.\n\n## Intended uses \n\nThis model can be used for binary classification task to determine whether a person makes over $500K a year or not.\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nThis model was trained using the [United States Census Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+%28KDD%29) provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. \nThe dataset consists of weighted census data containing demographic and employment related variables extracted from 1994 and 1995 Current Population Surveys conducted by the US Census Bureau.\nThe dataset comprises of ~299K samples with 41 input variables and 1 target variable called *income_level* \nThe variable *instance_weight* is not used as an input for the model so finally the model uses 40 input features containing 7 numerical features and 33 categorical features:\n\n| Numerical Features | Categorical Features |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| age | class of worker |\n| wage per hour | industry code |\n| capital gains | occupation code |\n| capital losses | adjusted gross income |\n| dividends from stocks | education |\n| num persons worked for employer | veterans benefits |\n| weeks worked in year | enrolled in edu inst last wk\n|| marital status |\n|| major industry code |\n|| major occupation code |\n|| mace |\n|| hispanic Origin |\n|| sex |\n|| member of a labor union |\n|| reason for unemployment |\n|| full or part time employment stat |\n|| federal income tax liability |\n|| tax filer status |\n|| region of previous residence |\n|| state of previous residence |\n|| detailed household and family stat |\n|| detailed household summary in household |\n|| migration code-change in msa |\n|| migration code-change in reg |\n|| migration code-move within reg |\n|| live in this house 1 year ago |\n|| migration prev res in sunbelt |\n|| family members under 18 |\n|| total person earnings |\n|| country of birth father |\n|| country of birth mother |\n|| country of birth self |\n|| citizenship |\n|| total person income |\n|| own business or self employed |\n|| taxable income amount |\n|| fill inc questionnaire for veteran's admin |\n\nThe dataset already comes in two parts meant for training and testing.\nThe training dataset has 199523 samples whereas the test dataset has 99762 samples.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n1. **Prepare Data:** Load the training and test datasets and convert the target column *income_level* from string to integer. The training dataset is further split into train and validation sets.\nFinally, the training and validation datasets are then converted into a tf.data.Dataset meant to be used for model training and evaluation.\n\n2. **Define logic for Encoding input features:** We encode the categorical and numerical features as follows:\n   \n   - **Categorical Features:** are encoded using *Embedding* layer provided by Keras. The output dimension of the embedding is equal to *encoding_size*\n  \n   - **Numerical Features:** are projected into a *encoding_size* dimensional vector by applying a linear transformation using *Dense* layer provided by Keras\n   \n   Therefore, all the encoded features will have the same dimensionality equal to the value of *encoding_size*.\n\n3. **Create Model:** \n   - The model will have input layers corresponding to both numerical and categorical features of the given dataset\n   - The features received by the input layers are then encoded using the encoding logic defined in Step 2 with an *encoding_size* of 16 indicating the output dimension of the encoded features. \n   - The encoded features pass through the Variable Selection Network(VSN). The VSN internally makes use of the GRN as well, as explained in the *Model Description* section.\n   - The features produced by the VSN are passed through a final *Dense* layer with sigmoid activation to produce the final output of the model indicating the probability for whether the income of a person is >500K or not.\n\n4. **Compile, Train and Evaluate Model**: \n   - Since the model is meant to binary classification, the loss function chosen was Binary Cross Entropy.\n   - The metric chosen for evaluating the model's performance was *accuracy*.\n   - The optimizer chosen was Adam with a learning rate of 0.001.\n   - The dropout_rate for the Dropout Layers of the GRN was 0.15\n   - The batch_size chosen was 265 and the model was trained for 20 epochs.\n   - The training was done with a Keras callback for *EarlyStopping* which means the training would be interrupted as soon as the validation metrics have stopped improving.\n   - Finally the performance of the model was also evaluated on the test_dataset reaching an accuracy of ~95%\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n\n| Hyperparameters | Value |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| name | Adam |\n| learning_rate | 0.0010000000474974513 |\n| decay | 0.0 |\n| beta_1 | 0.8999999761581421 |\n| beta_2 | 0.9990000128746033 |\n| epsilon | 1e-07 |\n| amsgrad | False |\n| training_precision | float32 |\n\n\n ## Model Plot\n\n<details>\n<summary>View Model Plot</summary>\n\n![Model Image](./model.png)\n\n</details>\n\n## Credits:\n\n- HF Contribution: [Shivalika Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivalika-singh)\n- Full credits to original [Keras example](https://keras.io/examples/structured_data/classification_with_grn_and_vsn) by [Khalid Salama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khalid-salama-24403144)\n- Check out the demo space [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/keras-io/structured-data-classification-grn-vsn)\n", "Ramos-Ramos/emb-gam-dino": "\n\n# Model description\n\nThis is a LogisticRegressionCV model trained on averages of patch embeddings from the Imagenette dataset.

This takes 3 days, with 4 images per GPU (hence a total batch size of 64).\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nThis model achieves an AP (average precision) of **43.5** on COCO 2017 validation.

OWL-ViT is a zero-shot text-conditioned object detection model that can be used to query an image with one or multiple text queries.  \n\nOWL-ViT uses CLIP as its multi-modal backbone, with a ViT-like Transformer to get visual features and a causal language model to get the text features. To use CLIP for detection, OWL-ViT removes the final token pooling layer of the vision model and attaches a lightweight classification and box head to each transformer output token. Open-vocabulary classification is enabled by replacing the fixed classification layer weights with the class-name embeddings obtained from the text model. The authors first train CLIP from scratch and fine-tune it end-to-end with the classification and box heads on standard detection datasets using a bipartite matching loss. One or multiple text queries per image can be used to perform zero-shot text-conditioned object detection. \n\n\n### Model Date\n\nMay 2022\n\n### Model Type\n\nThe model uses a CLIP backbone with a ViT-B/32 Transformer architecture as an image encoder and uses a masked self-attention Transformer as a text encoder. These encoders are trained to maximize the similarity of (image, text) pairs via a contrastive loss. The CLIP backbone is trained from scratch and fine-tuned together with the box and class prediction heads with an object detection objective.\n\n\n### Documents\n\n- [OWL-ViT Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06230)\n\n\n### Use with Transformers\n\n```python3\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport torch\n\nfrom transformers import OwlViTProcessor, OwlViTForObjectDetection\n\nprocessor = OwlViTProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/owlvit-base-patch32\")\nmodel = OwlViTForObjectDetection.from_pretrained(\"google/owlvit-base-patch32\")\n\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\ntexts = [[\"a photo of a cat\", \"a photo of a dog\"]]\ninputs = processor(text=texts, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# Target image sizes (height, width) to rescale box predictions [batch_size, 2]\ntarget_sizes = torch.Tensor([image.size[::-1]])\n# Convert outputs (bounding boxes and class logits) to COCO API\nresults = processor.post_process(outputs=outputs, target_sizes=target_sizes)\n\ni = 0  # Retrieve predictions for the first image for the corresponding text queries\ntext = texts[i]\nboxes, scores, labels = results[i][\"boxes\"], results[i][\"scores\"], results[i][\"labels\"]\n\n# Print detected objects and rescaled box coordinates\nscore_threshold = 0.1\nfor box, score, label in zip(boxes, scores, labels):\n    box = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]\n    if score >= score_threshold:\n        print(f\"Detected {text[label]} with confidence {round(score.item(), 3)} at location {box}\")\n```\n\n\n## Model Use\n\n### Intended Use\n\nThe model is intended as a research output for research communities. We hope that this model will enable researchers to better understand and explore zero-shot, text-conditioned object detection. We also hope it can be used for interdisciplinary studies of the potential impact of such models, especially in areas that commonly require identifying objects whose label is unavailable during training.\n\n#### Primary intended uses\n\nThe primary intended users of these models are AI researchers.\n\nWe primarily imagine the model will be used by researchers to better understand robustness, generalization, and other capabilities, biases, and constraints of computer vision models.\n\n## Data\n\nThe CLIP backbone of the model was trained on publicly available image-caption data. This was done through a combination of crawling a handful of websites and using commonly-used pre-existing image datasets such as [YFCC100M](http://projects.dfki.uni-kl.de/yfcc100m/). A large portion of the data comes from our crawling of the internet. This means that the data is more representative of people and societies most connected to the internet. The prediction heads of OWL-ViT, along with the CLIP backbone, are fine-tuned on publicly available object detection datasets such as [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home) and [OpenImages](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html).\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{minderer2022simple,\n  title={Simple Open-Vocabulary Object Detection with Vision Transformers},\n  author={Matthias Minderer, Alexey Gritsenko, Austin Stone, Maxim Neumann, Dirk Weissenborn, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Aravindh Mahendran, Anurag Arnab, Mostafa Dehghani, Zhuoran Shen, Xiao Wang, Xiaohua Zhai, Thomas Kipf, Neil Houlsby},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.06230},\n  year={2022},\n}\n```", "TahaDouaji/detr-doc-table-detection": "\n\n# Model Card for detr-doc-table-detection\n \n# Model Details\n \ndetr-doc-table-detection is a model trained to detect both **Bordered** and **Borderless** tables in documents, based on [facebook/detr-resnet-50](https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50).\n \n- **Developed by:** Taha Douaji\n- **Shared by [Optional]:** Taha Douaji\n- **Model type:** Object Detection \n- **Language(s) (NLP):** More information needed\n- **License:** More information needed \n- **Parent Model:** [facebook/detr-resnet-50](https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50)\n- **Resources for more information:**\n    - [Model Demo Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/trevbeers/pdf-table-extraction)\n   - [Associated Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872)\n \t\n\n\n# Uses\n \n\n## Direct Use\nThis model can be used for the task of object detection.\n \n## Out-of-Scope Use\n \nThe model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. \n \n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n \n \nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al.

It was introduced in the paper [End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872) by Carion et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing DETR did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nThe DETR model is an encoder-decoder transformer with a convolutional backbone. Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. \n\nThe model is trained using a \"bipartite matching loss\": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a \"no object\" as class and \"no bounding box\" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for object detection. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=facebook/detr) to look for all available DETR models.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DetrFeatureExtractor, DetrForObjectDetection\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nfeature_extractor = DetrFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('facebook/detr-resnet-101-dc5')\nmodel = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained('facebook/detr-resnet-101-dc5')\n\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# model predicts bounding boxes and corresponding COCO classes\nlogits = outputs.logits\nbboxes = outputs.pred_boxes\n```\n\nCurrently, both the feature extractor and model support PyTorch. \n\n## Training data\n\nThe DETR model was trained on [COCO 2017 object detection](https://cocodataset.org/#download), a dataset consisting of 118k/5k annotated images for training/validation respectively. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe exact details of preprocessing of images during training/validation can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/master/vit_jax/input_pipeline.py). \n\nImages are resized/rescaled such that the shortest side is at least 800 pixels and the largest side at most 1333 pixels, and normalized across the RGB channels with the ImageNet mean (0.485, 0.456, 0.406) and standard deviation (0.229, 0.224, 0.225).\n\n### Training\n\nThe model was trained for 300 epochs on 16 V100 GPUs. This takes 3 days, with 4 images per GPU (hence a total batch size of 64).\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nThis model achieves an AP (average precision) of **44.9** on COCO 2017 validation.

It was introduced in the paper [Deformable DETR: Deformable Transformers for End-to-End Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04159) by Zhu et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR). \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing Deformable DETR did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nThe DETR model is an encoder-decoder transformer with a convolutional backbone. Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. \n\nThe model is trained using a \"bipartite matching loss\": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a \"no object\" as class and \"no bounding box\" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.\n\n![model image](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/deformable_detr_architecture.png)\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for object detection.

OWL-ViT is a zero-shot text-conditioned object detection model that can be used to query an image with one or multiple text queries.  \n\nOWL-ViT uses CLIP as its multi-modal backbone, with a ViT-like Transformer to get visual features and a causal language model to get the text features. To use CLIP for detection, OWL-ViT removes the final token pooling layer of the vision model and attaches a lightweight classification and box head to each transformer output token. Open-vocabulary classification is enabled by replacing the fixed classification layer weights with the class-name embeddings obtained from the text model. The authors first train CLIP from scratch and fine-tune it end-to-end with the classification and box heads on standard detection datasets using a bipartite matching loss. One or multiple text queries per image can be used to perform zero-shot text-conditioned object detection. \n\n\n### Model Date\n\nMay 2022\n\n### Model Type\n\nThe model uses a CLIP backbone with a ViT-B/16 Transformer architecture as an image encoder and uses a masked self-attention Transformer as a text encoder. These encoders are trained to maximize the similarity of (image, text) pairs via a contrastive loss. The CLIP backbone is trained from scratch and fine-tuned together with the box and class prediction heads with an object detection objective.\n\n\n### Documents\n\n- [OWL-ViT Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06230)\n\n\n### Use with Transformers\n\n```python3\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport torch\n\nfrom transformers import OwlViTProcessor, OwlViTForObjectDetection\n\nprocessor = OwlViTProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/owlvit-base-patch16\")\nmodel = OwlViTForObjectDetection.from_pretrained(\"google/owlvit-base-patch16\")\n\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\ntexts = [[\"a photo of a cat\", \"a photo of a dog\"]]\ninputs = processor(text=texts, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# Target image sizes (height, width) to rescale box predictions [batch_size, 2]\ntarget_sizes = torch.Tensor([image.size[::-1]])\n# Convert outputs (bounding boxes and class logits) to COCO API\nresults = processor.post_process(outputs=outputs, target_sizes=target_sizes)\n\ni = 0  # Retrieve predictions for the first image for the corresponding text queries\ntext = texts[i]\nboxes, scores, labels = results[i][\"boxes\"], results[i][\"scores\"], results[i][\"labels\"]\n\n# Print detected objects and rescaled box coordinates\nscore_threshold = 0.1\nfor box, score, label in zip(boxes, scores, labels):\n    box = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]\n    if score >= score_threshold:\n        print(f\"Detected {text[label]} with confidence {round(score.item(), 3)} at location {box}\")\n```\n\n\n## Model Use\n\n### Intended Use\n\nThe model is intended as a research output for research communities. We hope that this model will enable researchers to better understand and explore zero-shot, text-conditioned object detection. We also hope it can be used for interdisciplinary studies of the potential impact of such models, especially in areas that commonly require identifying objects whose label is unavailable during training.\n\n#### Primary intended uses\n\nThe primary intended users of these models are AI researchers.\n\nWe primarily imagine the model will be used by researchers to better understand robustness, generalization, and other capabilities, biases, and constraints of computer vision models.\n\n## Data\n\nThe CLIP backbone of the model was trained on publicly available image-caption data. This was done through a combination of crawling a handful of websites and using commonly-used pre-existing image datasets such as [YFCC100M](http://projects.dfki.uni-kl.de/yfcc100m/). A large portion of the data comes from our crawling of the internet. This means that the data is more representative of people and societies most connected to the internet. The prediction heads of OWL-ViT, along with the CLIP backbone, are fine-tuned on publicly available object detection datasets such as [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home) and [OpenImages](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html).\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{minderer2022simple,\n  title={Simple Open-Vocabulary Object Detection with Vision Transformers},\n  author={Matthias Minderer, Alexey Gritsenko, Austin Stone, Maxim Neumann, Dirk Weissenborn, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Aravindh Mahendran, Anurag Arnab, Mostafa Dehghani, Zhuoran Shen, Xiao Wang, Xiaohua Zhai, Thomas Kipf, Neil Houlsby},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.06230},\n  year={2022},\n}\n```", "biglam/detr-resnet-50_fine_tuned_nls_chapbooks": "\n\n<!-- This model card has been generated automatically according to the information the Trainer had access to.

One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.\n\nBy pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for image classification.

All model variants are trained with a batch size of 4096 and learning rate warmup of 10k steps. For ImageNet, the authors found it beneficial to additionally apply gradient clipping at global norm 1. Training resolution is 224.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nFor evaluation results on several image classification benchmarks, we refer to tables 2 and 5 of the original paper. Note that for fine-tuning, the best results are obtained with a higher resolution (384x384).

This image classifier is trained on approximately 3.5k real-life and anime/manga images. Its purpose is to remove aesthetically worthless images from our dataset by classifying them as \"`not_aesthetic`\". The image classifier was trained to **err on the side of caution** and will generally tend to include images unless they are in a \"manga-like\" format, have messy lines and/or are sketches, or include an unacceptable amount of text (namely text that covers the primary subject of the image).

Low quality AI generations have a higher chance of being misclassified\n - Textual inversions and hypernetworks increase the chance of misclassification\n\n### Training\nThis model was trained from microsoft/beit-base-patch16-224 for one epoch on 11 thousand images from imageboard sites, and 11 thousand images from aibooru.\n\nYou can view the wandb run [here](https://wandb.ai/saltacc/huggingface/runs/2mp30x7j?workspace=user-saltacc).\n\n\n### Use Case\nI don't intend for this model to be more accurate than humans for detecting AI art.\nI think the best use cases for this model would be for cases where misclassification isn't a big deal, such as\nremoving AI art from a training dataset.", "Rajaram1996/FacialEmoRecog": "\n\n\n\n\n# metrics:\n# - accuracy\n\n# model-index:\n# - name: FacialEmoRecog\n#  results:\n # - task:\n  #    name: Image Classification\n #     type: image-classification\n # - metrics:\n #     name: Accuracy\n  #    type: accuracy\n   #   value: 0.9189583659172058\n\n# FacialEmoRecog \nCreate your own image classifier for **anything** by running this repo  \n\n ## Example Images", "google/vit-base-patch16-384": "\n\n# Vision Transformer (base-sized model) \n\nVision Transformer (ViT) model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k (14 million images, 21,843 classes) at resolution 224x224, and fine-tuned on ImageNet 2012 (1 million images, 1,000 classes) at resolution 384x384. It was introduced in the paper [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) by Dosovitskiy et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer).

Credits go to him. \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing ViT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nThe Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like) pretrained on a large collection of images in a supervised fashion, namely ImageNet-21k, at a resolution of 224x224 pixels. Next, the model was fine-tuned on ImageNet (also referred to as ILSVRC2012), a dataset comprising 1 million images and 1,000 classes, at a higher resolution of 384x384.\n\nImages are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.\n\nBy pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for image classification. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=google/vit) to look for\nfine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model to classify an image of the COCO 2017 dataset into one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, ViTForImageClassification\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\nurl = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\nfeature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-384')\nmodel = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-384')\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\n# model predicts one of the 1000 ImageNet classes\npredicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()\nprint(\"Predicted class:\", model.config.id2label[predicted_class_idx])\n```\n\nCurrently, both the feature extractor and model  support PyTorch. Tensorflow and JAX/FLAX are coming soon, and the API of ViTFeatureExtractor might change.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe ViT model was pretrained on [ImageNet-21k](http://www.image-net.org/), a dataset consisting of 14 million images and 21k classes, and fine-tuned on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/), a dataset consisting of 1 million images and 1k classes. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe exact details of preprocessing of images during training/validation can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/master/vit_jax/input_pipeline.py). \n\nImages are resized/rescaled to the same resolution (224x224 during pre-training, 384x384 during fine-tuning) and normalized across the RGB channels with mean (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and standard deviation (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on TPUv3 hardware (8 cores). All model variants are trained with a batch size of 4096 and learning rate warmup of 10k steps. For ImageNet, the authors found it beneficial to additionally apply gradient clipping at global norm 1. Pre-training resolution is 224.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nFor evaluation results on several image classification benchmarks, we refer to tables 2 and 5 of the original paper. Note that for fine-tuning, the best results are obtained with a higher resolution (384x384). Of course, increasing the model size will result in better performance.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{wu2020visual,\n      title={Visual Transformers: Token-based Image Representation and Processing for Computer Vision}, \n      author={Bichen Wu and Chenfeng Xu and Xiaoliang Dai and Alvin Wan and Peizhao Zhang and Zhicheng Yan and Masayoshi Tomizuka and Joseph Gonzalez and Kurt Keutzer and Peter Vajda},\n      year={2020},\n      eprint={2006.03677},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CV}\n}\n```\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{deng2009imagenet,\n  title={Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database},\n  author={Deng, Jia and Dong, Wei and Socher, Richard and Li, Li-Jia and Li, Kai and Fei-Fei, Li},\n  booktitle={2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition},\n  pages={248--255},\n  year={2009},\n  organization={Ieee}\n}\n```", "microsoft/swin-tiny-patch4-window7-224": "\n\n# Swin Transformer (tiny-sized model) \n\nSwin Transformer model trained on ImageNet-1k at resolution 224x224.

The core idea is to employ the self-attention mechanism on a not-too-large set of latent vectors (e.g. 256 or 512), and only use the inputs to perform cross-attention with the latents. This allows for the time and memory requirements of the self-attention mechanism to not depend on the size of the inputs. \n\nTo decode, the authors employ so-called decoder queries, which allow to flexibly decode the final hidden states of the latents to produce outputs of arbitrary size and semantics. For image classification, the output is a tensor containing the logits, of shape (batch_size, num_labels).\n\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/perceiver_architecture.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n\n<small> Perceiver IO architecture.</small>\n\nAs the time and memory requirements of the self-attention mechanism don't depend on the size of the inputs, the Perceiver IO authors can train the model directly on raw pixel values, rather than on patches as is done in ViT. This particular model only adds learned 1D position embeddings to the pixel values, hence it is given no privileged information about the 2D structure of images.\n\nBy pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by replacing the classification decoder.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for image classification.

It was introduced in [MobileViT: Light-weight, General-purpose, and Mobile-friendly Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02178) by Sachin Mehta and Mohammad Rastegari, and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets). The license used is [Apple sample code license](https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing MobileViT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nMobileViT is a light-weight, low latency convolutional neural network that combines MobileNetV2-style layers with a new block that replaces local processing in convolutions with global processing using transformers. As with ViT (Vision Transformer), the image data is converted into flattened patches before it is processed by the transformer layers. Afterwards, the patches are \"unflattened\" back into feature maps. This allows the MobileViT-block to be placed anywhere inside a CNN. MobileViT does not require any positional embeddings.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for image classification. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=mobilevit) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model to classify an image of the COCO 2017 dataset into one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import MobileViTFeatureExtractor, MobileViTForImageClassification\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nfeature_extractor = MobileViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"apple/mobilevit-small\")\nmodel = MobileViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained(\"apple/mobilevit-small\")\n\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\n\n# model predicts one of the 1000 ImageNet classes\npredicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()\nprint(\"Predicted class:\", model.config.id2label[predicted_class_idx])\n```\n\nCurrently, both the feature extractor and model support PyTorch.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe MobileViT model was pretrained on [ImageNet-1k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k), a dataset consisting of 1 million images and 1,000 classes. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nTraining requires only basic data augmentation, i.e. random resized cropping and horizontal flipping. \n\nTo learn multi-scale representations without requiring fine-tuning, a multi-scale sampler was used during training, with image sizes randomly sampled from: (160, 160), (192, 192), (256, 256), (288, 288), (320, 320).\n\nAt inference time, images are resized/rescaled to the same resolution (288x288), and center-cropped at 256x256.\n\nPixels are normalized to the range [0, 1]. Images are expected to be in BGR pixel order, not RGB.\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe MobileViT networks are trained from scratch for 300 epochs on ImageNet-1k on 8 NVIDIA GPUs with an effective batch size of 1024 and learning rate warmup for 3k steps, followed by cosine annealing. Also used were label smoothing cross-entropy loss and L2 weight decay.

Next, the model was fine-tuned on ImageNet (also referred to as ILSVRC2012), a dataset comprising 1 million images and 1,000 classes, at a higher resolution of 384x384.\n\nImages are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 32x32), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.\n\nBy pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for image classification. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=google/vit) to look for\nfine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model to classify an image of the COCO 2017 dataset into one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, ViTForImageClassification\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\nurl = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\nfeature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch32-384')\nmodel = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch32-384')\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\n# model predicts one of the 1000 ImageNet classes\npredicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()\nprint(\"Predicted class:\", model.config.id2label[predicted_class_idx])\n```\n\nCurrently, both the feature extractor and model  support PyTorch. Tensorflow and JAX/FLAX are coming soon, and the API of ViTFeatureExtractor might change.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe ViT model was pretrained on [ImageNet-21k](http://www.image-net.org/), a dataset consisting of 14 million images and 21k classes, and fine-tuned on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/), a dataset consisting of 1 million images and 1k classes. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe exact details of preprocessing of images during training/validation can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/master/vit_jax/input_pipeline.py). \n\nImages are resized/rescaled to the same resolution (224x224 during pre-training, 384x384 during fine-tuning) and normalized across the RGB channels with mean (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and standard deviation (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on TPUv3 hardware (8 cores). All model variants are trained with a batch size of 4096 and learning rate warmup of 10k steps. For ImageNet, the authors found it beneficial to additionally apply gradient clipping at global norm 1. Pre-training resolution is 224.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nFor evaluation results on several image classification benchmarks, we refer to tables 2 and 5 of the original paper. Note that for fine-tuning, the best results are obtained with a higher resolution (384x384). Of course, increasing the model size will result in better performance.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2010.11929,\n  doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2010.11929},\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929},\n  author = {Dosovitskiy, Alexey and Beyer, Lucas and Kolesnikov, Alexander and Weissenborn, Dirk and Zhai, Xiaohua and Unterthiner, Thomas and Dehghani, Mostafa and Minderer, Matthias and Heigold, Georg and Gelly, Sylvain and Uszkoreit, Jakob and Houlsby, Neil},\n  keywords = {Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), FOS: Computer and information sciences, FOS: Computer and information sciences},\n  title = {An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale},\n  publisher = {arXiv},\n  year = {2020},\n  copyright = {arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license}\n}\n\n\n```\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{deng2009imagenet,\n  title={Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database},\n  author={Deng, Jia and Dong, Wei and Socher, Richard and Li, Li-Jia and Li, Kai and Fei-Fei, Li},\n  booktitle={2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition},\n  pages={248--255},\n  year={2009},\n  organization={Ieee}\n}\n```", "mindspore-ai/LeNet": "\n\n## MindSpore Image Classification models with MNIST on the \ud83e\udd17Hub! \n\nThis repository contains the model from [this notebook on image classification with MNIST dataset using LeNet architecture](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.2/model_zoo/official/cv/lenet/README.md#). \n\n## LeNet Description\nLenet-5 is one of the earliest pre-trained models proposed by Yann LeCun and others in the year 1998, in the research paper Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition.

Next, the model was fine-tuned on ImageNet (also referred to as ILSVRC2012), a dataset comprising 1 million images and 1,000 classes, at a higher resolution of 384x384.\n\nImages are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.\n\nBy pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for image classification. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=google/vit) to look for\nfine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model to classify an image of the COCO 2017 dataset into one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, ViTForImageClassification\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\nurl = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\nfeature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('google/vit-large-patch16-384')\nmodel = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained('google/vit-large-patch16-384')\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\n# model predicts one of the 1000 ImageNet classes\npredicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()\nprint(\"Predicted class:\", model.config.id2label[predicted_class_idx])\n```\n\nCurrently, both the feature extractor and model  support PyTorch. Tensorflow and JAX/FLAX are coming soon, and the API of ViTFeatureExtractor might change.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe ViT model was pretrained on [ImageNet-21k](http://www.image-net.org/), a dataset consisting of 14 million images and 21k classes, and fine-tuned on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/), a dataset consisting of 1 million images and 1k classes. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe exact details of preprocessing of images during training/validation can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/master/vit_jax/input_pipeline.py). \n\nImages are resized/rescaled to the same resolution (224x224 during pre-training, 384x384 during fine-tuning) and normalized across the RGB channels with mean (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and standard deviation (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on TPUv3 hardware (8 cores). All model variants are trained with a batch size of 4096 and learning rate warmup of 10k steps. For ImageNet, the authors found it beneficial to additionally apply gradient clipping at global norm 1. Pre-training resolution is 224.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nFor evaluation results on several image classification benchmarks, we refer to tables 2 and 5 of the original paper. Note that for fine-tuning, the best results are obtained with a higher resolution (384x384). Of course, increasing the model size will result in better performance.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{wu2020visual,\n      title={Visual Transformers: Token-based Image Representation and Processing for Computer Vision}, \n      author={Bichen Wu and Chenfeng Xu and Xiaoliang Dai and Alvin Wan and Peizhao Zhang and Zhicheng Yan and Masayoshi Tomizuka and Joseph Gonzalez and Kurt Keutzer and Peter Vajda},\n      year={2020},\n      eprint={2006.03677},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CV}\n}\n```\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{deng2009imagenet,\n  title={Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database},\n  author={Deng, Jia and Dong, Wei and Socher, Richard and Li, Li-Jia and Li, Kai and Fei-Fei, Li},\n  booktitle={2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition},\n  pages={248--255},\n  year={2009},\n  organization={Ieee}\n}\n```", "google/vit-large-patch32-384": "\n\n# Vision Transformer (large-sized model) \n\nVision Transformer (ViT) model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k (14 million images, 21,843 classes) at resolution 224x224, and fine-tuned on ImageNet 2012 (1 million images, 1,000 classes) at resolution 384x384.

[TL;DR](#TL;DR)\n1. [Using the model](#using-the-model)\n2. [Contribution](#contribution)\n3. [Citation](#citation)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nPix2Struct is an image encoder - text decoder model that is trained on image-text pairs for various tasks, including image captionning and visual question answering. The full list of available models can be found on the Table 1 of the paper:\n\n![Table 1 - paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1678712985040-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\n\n\nThe abstract of the model states that: \n> Visually-situated language is ubiquitous\u2014sources range from textbooks with diagrams to web pages with images and tables, to mobile apps with buttons and\nforms. Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domainspecific recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures,\nand objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for\npurely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse\nmasked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large\nsource of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy,\nwe introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions\nare rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a\nsingle pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks\nacross four domains: documents, illustrations, user interfaces, and natural images.\n\n# Using the model \n\n## Converting from T5x to huggingface\n\nYou can use the [`convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/pix2struct/convert_pix2struct_original_pytorch_to_hf.py) script as follows:\n```bash\npython convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py --t5x_checkpoint_path PATH_TO_T5X_CHECKPOINTS --pytorch_dump_path PATH_TO_SAVE\n```\nif you are converting a large model, run:\n```bash\npython convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py --t5x_checkpoint_path PATH_TO_T5X_CHECKPOINTS --pytorch_dump_path PATH_TO_SAVE --use-large\n```\nOnce saved, you can push your converted model with the following snippet:\n```python\nfrom transformers import Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration, Pix2StructProcessor\n\nmodel = Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(PATH_TO_SAVE)\nprocessor = Pix2StructProcessor.from_pretrained(PATH_TO_SAVE)\n\nmodel.push_to_hub(\"USERNAME/MODEL_NAME\")\nprocessor.push_to_hub(\"USERNAME/MODEL_NAME\")\n```\n\n# Contribution\n\nThis model was originally contributed by Kenton Lee, Mandar Joshi et al. and added to the Hugging Face ecosystem by [Younes Belkada](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada).\n\n# Citation\n\nIf you want to cite this work, please consider citing the original paper:\n```\n@misc{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2210.03347,\n  doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2210.03347},\n  \n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03347},\n  \n  author = {Lee, Kenton and Joshi, Mandar and Turc, Iulia and Hu, Hexiang and Liu, Fangyu and Eisenschlos, Julian and Khandelwal, Urvashi and Shaw, Peter and Chang, Ming-Wei and Toutanova, Kristina},\n  \n  keywords = {Computation and Language (cs.CL), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), FOS: Computer and information sciences, FOS: Computer and information sciences},\n  \n  title = {Pix2Struct: Screenshot Parsing as Pretraining for Visual Language Understanding},\n  \n  publisher = {arXiv},\n  \n  year = {2022},\n  \n  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International}\n}\n```", "Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b": "\n\n# BLIP-2, OPT-2.7b, pre-trained only\n\nBLIP-2 model, leveraging [OPT-2.7b](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-2.7b) (a large language model with 2.7 billion parameters).\nIt was introduced in the paper [BLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12597) by Li et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/tree/main/projects/blip2).\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing BLIP-2 did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nBLIP-2 consists of 3 models: a CLIP-like image encoder, a Querying Transformer (Q-Former) and a large language model.\n\nThe authors initialize the weights of the image encoder and large language model from pre-trained checkpoints and keep them frozen\nwhile training the Querying Transformer, which is a BERT-like Transformer encoder that maps a set of \"query tokens\" to query embeddings,\nwhich bridge the gap between the embedding space of the image encoder and the large language model.\n\nThe goal for the model is simply to predict the next text token, giving the query embeddings and the previous text.\n\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/blip2_architecture.jpg\"\nalt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/> \n\nThis allows the model to be used for tasks like:\n\n- image captioning\n- visual question answering (VQA)\n- chat-like conversations by feeding the image and the previous conversation as prompt to the model\n\n## Direct Use and Downstream Use\n\nYou can use the raw model for conditional text generation given an image and optional text.

[TL;DR](#TL;DR)\n1. [Using the model](#using-the-model)\n2. [Contribution](#contribution)\n3. [Citation](#citation)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nPix2Struct is an image encoder - text decoder model that is trained on image-text pairs for various tasks, including image captionning and visual question answering. The full list of available models can be found on the Table 1 of the paper:\n\n![Table 1 - paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1678712985040-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\n\n\nThe abstract of the model states that: \n> Visually-situated language is ubiquitous\u2014sources range from textbooks with diagrams to web pages with images and tables, to mobile apps with buttons and\nforms. Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domainspecific recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures,\nand objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for\npurely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse\nmasked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large\nsource of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy,\nwe introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions\nare rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a\nsingle pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks\nacross four domains: documents, illustrations, user interfaces, and natural images.\n\n# Using the model \n\n## Converting from T5x to huggingface\n\nYou can use the [`convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/pix2struct/convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py) script as follows:\n```bash\npython convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py --t5x_checkpoint_path PATH_TO_T5X_CHECKPOINTS --pytorch_dump_path PATH_TO_SAVE\n```\nif you are converting a large model, run:\n```bash\npython convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py --t5x_checkpoint_path PATH_TO_T5X_CHECKPOINTS --pytorch_dump_path PATH_TO_SAVE --use-large\n```\nOnce saved, you can push your converted model with the following snippet:\n```python\nfrom transformers import Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration, Pix2StructProcessor\n\nmodel = Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(PATH_TO_SAVE)\nprocessor = Pix2StructProcessor.from_pretrained(PATH_TO_SAVE)\n\nmodel.push_to_hub(\"USERNAME/MODEL_NAME\")\nprocessor.push_to_hub(\"USERNAME/MODEL_NAME\")\n```\n\n## Running the model\n\n### In full precision, on CPU:\n\nYou can run the model in full precision on CPU:\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration, Pix2StructProcessor\n\nurl = \"https://www.ilankelman.org/stopsigns/australia.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nmodel = Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-base\")\nprocessor = Pix2StructProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-base\")\n\n# image only\ninputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\npredictions = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(predictions[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n>>> A stop sign is on a street corner.\n```\n\n### In full precision, on GPU:\n\nYou can run the model in full precision on CPU:\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration, Pix2StructProcessor\n\nurl = \"https://www.ilankelman.org/stopsigns/australia.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nmodel = Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-base\").to(\"cuda\")\nprocessor = Pix2StructProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-base\")\n\n# image only\ninputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\npredictions = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(predictions[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n>>> A stop sign is on a street corner.\n```\n\n### In half precision, on GPU:\n\nYou can run the model in full precision on CPU:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport torch\n\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration, Pix2StructProcessor\n\nurl = \"https://www.ilankelman.org/stopsigns/australia.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nmodel = Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-base\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to(\"cuda\")\nprocessor = Pix2StructProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-base\")\n\n# image only\ninputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\", torch.bfloat16)\n\npredictions = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(predictions[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n>>> A stop sign is on a street corner.\n```\n\n### Use different sequence length\n\nThis model has been trained on a sequence length of `2048`.

(2021). Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application, without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application.\n\nBLIP2 is fine-tuned on image-text datasets (e.g. [LAION](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-400-open-dataset/) ) collected from the internet.  As a result the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases in the underlying data.\n\nBLIP2 has not been tested in real world applications. It should not be directly deployed in any applications. Researchers should first carefully assess the safety and fairness of the model in relation to the specific context they\u2019re being deployed within.\n\n### How to use\n\nFor code examples, we refer to the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/blip-2#transformers.Blip2ForConditionalGeneration.forward.example).", "dhansmair/flamingo-mini": "\nFlamingo Model pretrained on Image Captioning on the Conceptual Captions (3M) dataset.  \nSource Code: https://github.com/dhansmair/flamingo-mini  \nDemo Space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/dhansmair/flamingo-mini-cap  \n  \nFlamingo-tiny: https://huggingface.co/spaces/dhansmair/flamingo-tiny-cap\n", "tuman/vit-rugpt2-image-captioning": "\n\n# First image captioning model for russian language vit-rugpt2-image-captioning\n\nThis is an image captioning model trained on translated version (en-ru) of dataset COCO2014.\n\n# Model Details\n\nModel was initialized `google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k` for encoder and `sberbank-ai/rugpt3large_based_on_gpt2` for decoder.\n\n# Metrics on test data\n\n* Bleu: 8.672\n* Bleu precision 1: 30.567\n* Bleu precision 2: 7.895\n* Bleu precision 3: 3.261\n\n# Sample running code\n\n```python\n\nfrom transformers import VisionEncoderDecoderModel, ViTFeatureExtractor, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nmodel = VisionEncoderDecoderModel.from_pretrained(\"vit-rugpt2-image-captioning\")\nfeature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"vit-rugpt2-image-captioning\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"vit-rugpt2-image-captioning\")\n\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nmodel.to(device)\n\nmax_length = 16\nnum_beams = 4\ngen_kwargs = {\"max_length\": max_length, \"num_beams\": num_beams}\n\ndef predict_caption(image_paths):\n  images = []\n  for image_path in image_paths:\n    i_image = Image.open(image_path)\n    if i_image.mode != \"RGB\":\n      i_image = i_image.convert(mode=\"RGB\")\n\n    images.append(i_image)\n\n  pixel_values = feature_extractor(images=images, return_tensors=\"pt\").pixel_values\n  pixel_values = pixel_values.to(device)\n\n  output_ids = model.generate(pixel_values, **gen_kwargs)\n\n  preds = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n  preds = [pred.strip() for pred in preds]\n  return preds\n\npredict_caption(['train2014/COCO_train2014_000000295442.jpg']) # ['\u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0437\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0435 \u0430\u044d\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430.']\n\n```\n\n# Sample running code using transformers pipeline\n\n```python\n\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nimage_to_text = pipeline(\"image-to-text\", model=\"vit-rugpt2-image-captioning\")\n\nimage_to_text(\"train2014/COCO_train2014_000000296754.jpg\") # [{'generated_text': '\u0427\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u0441 \u0437\u043e\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c.'}]\n\n```\n\n\n# Contact for any help\n* https://huggingface.co/tuman\n* https://github.com/tumanov-a\n* https://t.me/tumanov_av", "microsoft/git-base": "\n\n# GIT (GenerativeImage2Text), base-sized\n\nGIT (short for GenerativeImage2Text) model, base-sized version.

[TL;DR](#TL;DR)\n1. [Using the model](#using-the-model)\n2. [Contribution](#contribution)\n3.

The full list of available models can be found on the Table 1 of the paper:\n\n![Table 1 - paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1678712985040-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\n\n\nThe abstract of the model states that: \n> Visually-situated language is ubiquitous\u2014sources range from textbooks with diagrams to web pages with images and tables, to mobile apps with buttons and\nforms. Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domainspecific recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures,\nand objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for\npurely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse\nmasked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large\nsource of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy,\nwe introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions\nare rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a\nsingle pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks\nacross four domains: documents, illustrations, user interfaces, and natural images.\n\n# Using the model \n\n## Converting from T5x to huggingface\n\nYou can use the [`convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/pix2struct/convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py) script as follows:\n```bash\npython convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py --t5x_checkpoint_path PATH_TO_T5X_CHECKPOINTS --pytorch_dump_path PATH_TO_SAVE\n```\nif you are converting a large model, run:\n```bash\npython convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py --t5x_checkpoint_path PATH_TO_T5X_CHECKPOINTS --pytorch_dump_path PATH_TO_SAVE --use-large\n```\nOnce saved, you can push your converted model with the following snippet:\n```python\nfrom transformers import Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration, Pix2StructProcessor\n\nmodel = Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(PATH_TO_SAVE)\nprocessor = Pix2StructProcessor.from_pretrained(PATH_TO_SAVE)\n\nmodel.push_to_hub(\"USERNAME/MODEL_NAME\")\nprocessor.push_to_hub(\"USERNAME/MODEL_NAME\")\n```\n\n## Running the model\n\n### In full precision, on CPU:\n\nYou can run the model in full precision on CPU:\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration, Pix2StructProcessor\n\nurl = \"https://www.ilankelman.org/stopsigns/australia.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nmodel = Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-base\")\nprocessor = Pix2StructProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-base\")\n\n# image only\ninputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\npredictions = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(predictions[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n>>> A street scene with a sign that says \"STOP\".\n```\n\n### In full precision, on GPU:\n\nYou can run the model in full precision on CPU:\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration, Pix2StructProcessor\n\nurl = \"https://www.ilankelman.org/stopsigns/australia.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nmodel = Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-large\").to(\"cuda\")\nprocessor = Pix2StructProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-large\")\n\n# image only\ninputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\npredictions = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(predictions[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n>>> A street scene with a sign that says \"STOP\".\n```\n\n### In half precision, on GPU:\n\nYou can run the model in full precision on CPU:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport torch\n\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration, Pix2StructProcessor\n\nurl = \"https://www.ilankelman.org/stopsigns/australia.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nmodel = Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-large\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to(\"cuda\")\nprocessor = Pix2StructProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-large\")\n\n# image only\ninputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\", torch.bfloat16)\n\npredictions = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(predictions[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n>>> A street scene with a sign that says \"STOP\".\n```\n\n### Use different sequence length\n\nThis model has been trained on a sequence length of `4096`.

Just pass `max_patches` when calling the processor:\n```python\ninputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\", max_patches=1024)\n```\n\n### Conditional generation\n\nYou can also pre-pend some input text to perform conditional generation:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration, Pix2StructProcessor\n\nurl = \"https://www.ilankelman.org/stopsigns/australia.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\ntext = \"A picture of\"\n\nmodel = Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-large\")\nprocessor = Pix2StructProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/pix2struct-textcaps-large\")\n\n# image only\ninputs = processor(images=image, text=text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\npredictions = model.generate(**inputs)\nprint(processor.decode(predictions[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n```\n\n# Contribution\n\nThis model was originally contributed by Kenton Lee, Mandar Joshi et al. and added to the Hugging Face ecosystem by [Younes Belkada](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada).\n\n# Citation\n\nIf you want to cite this work, please consider citing the original paper:\n```\n@misc{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2210.03347,\n  doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2210.03347},\n  \n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03347},\n  \n  author = {Lee, Kenton and Joshi, Mandar and Turc, Iulia and Hu, Hexiang and Liu, Fangyu and Eisenschlos, Julian and Khandelwal, Urvashi and Shaw, Peter and Chang, Ming-Wei and Toutanova, Kristina},\n  \n  keywords = {Computation and Language (cs.CL), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), FOS: Computer and information sciences, FOS: Computer and information sciences},\n  \n  title = {Pix2Struct: Screenshot Parsing as Pretraining for Visual Language Understanding},\n  \n  publisher = {arXiv},\n  \n  year = {2022},\n  \n  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International}\n}\n```", "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5": "\n\n# Stable Diffusion v1-5 Model Card\n\nStable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input.\nFor more information about how Stable Diffusion functions, please have a look at [\ud83e\udd17's Stable Diffusion blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion).\n\nThe **Stable-Diffusion-v1-5** checkpoint was initialized with the weights of the [Stable-Diffusion-v1-2](https:/steps/huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-2) \ncheckpoint and subsequently fine-tuned on 595k steps at resolution 512x512 on \"laion-aesthetics v2 5+\" and 10% dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).\n\nYou can use this both with the [\ud83e\udde8Diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) and the [RunwayML GitHub repository](https://github.com/runwayml/stable-diffusion).\n\n### Diffusers\n```py\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline\nimport torch\n\nmodel_id = \"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\"\npipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)\npipe = pipe.to(\"cuda\")\n\nprompt = \"a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars\"\nimage = pipe(prompt).images[0]  \n    \nimage.save(\"astronaut_rides_horse.png\")\n```\nFor more detailed instructions, use-cases and examples in JAX follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers#text-to-image-generation-with-stable-diffusion)\n\n### Original GitHub Repository\n\n1.

Possible research areas and\ntasks include\n\n- Safe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content.\n- Probing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models.\n- Generation of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes.\n- Applications in educational or creative tools.\n- Research on generative models.\n\nExcluded uses are described below.\n\n ### Misuse, Malicious Use, and Out-of-Scope Use\n_Note: This section is taken from the [DALLE-MINI model card](https://huggingface.co/dalle-mini/dalle-mini), but applies in the same way to Stable Diffusion v1_.\n\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate images that create hostile or alienating environments for people. This includes generating images that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.\n\n#### Out-of-Scope Use\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n#### Misuse and Malicious Use\nUsing the model to generate content that is cruel to individuals is a misuse of this model. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Generating demeaning, dehumanizing, or otherwise harmful representations of people or their environments, cultures, religions, etc.\n- Intentionally promoting or propagating discriminatory content or harmful stereotypes.\n- Impersonating individuals without their consent.\n- Sexual content without consent of the people who might see it.\n- Mis- and disinformation\n- Representations of egregious violence and gore\n- Sharing of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\n- Sharing content that is an alteration of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\n\n## Limitations and Bias\n\n### Limitations\n\n- The model does not achieve perfect photorealism\n- The model cannot render legible text\n- The model does not perform well on more difficult tasks which involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to \u201cA red cube on top of a blue sphere\u201d\n- Faces and people in general may not be generated properly.\n- The model was trained mainly with English captions and will not work as well in other languages.\n- The autoencoding part of the model is lossy\n- The model was trained on a large-scale dataset\n  [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) which contains adult material\n  and is not fit for product use without additional safety mechanisms and\n  considerations.\n- No additional measures were used to deduplicate the dataset. As a result, we observe some degree of memorization for images that are duplicated in the training data.\n  The training data can be searched at [https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/](https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/) to possibly assist in the detection of memorized images.\n\n### Bias\n\nWhile the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases. \nStable Diffusion v1 was trained on subsets of [LAION-2B(en)](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), \nwhich consists of images that are primarily limited to English descriptions. \nTexts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for. \nThis affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Further, the \nability of the model to generate content with non-English prompts is significantly worse than with English-language prompts.\n\n### Safety Module\n\nThe intended use of this model is with the [Safety Checker](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable_diffusion/safety_checker.py) in Diffusers. \nThis checker works by checking model outputs against known hard-coded NSFW concepts.\nThe concepts are intentionally hidden to reduce the likelihood of reverse-engineering this filter.\nSpecifically, the checker compares the class probability of harmful concepts in the embedding space of the `CLIPTextModel` *after generation* of the images. \nThe concepts are passed into the model with the generated image and compared to a hand-engineered weight for each NSFW concept.\n\n\n## Training\n\n**Training Data**\nThe model developers used the following dataset for training the model:\n\n- LAION-2B (en) and subsets thereof (see next section)\n\n**Training Procedure**\nStable Diffusion v1-5 is a latent diffusion model which combines an autoencoder with a diffusion model that is trained in the latent space of the autoencoder. During training, \n\n- Images are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4\n- Text prompts are encoded through a ViT-L/14 text-encoder.\n- The non-pooled output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.\n- The loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet.\n\nCurrently six Stable Diffusion checkpoints are provided, which were trained as follows.\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-1`](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-1): 237,000 steps at resolution `256x256` on [laion2B-en](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-en).\n  194,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on [laion-high-resolution](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion-high-resolution) (170M examples from LAION-5B with resolution `>= 1024x1024`).\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-2`](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-2): Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-1`.\n  515,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on \"laion-improved-aesthetics\" (a subset of laion2B-en,\nfiltered to images with an original size `>= 512x512`, estimated aesthetics score `> 5.0`, and an estimated watermark probability `< 0.5`. The watermark estimate is from the LAION-5B metadata, the aesthetics score is estimated using an [improved aesthetics estimator](https://github.com/christophschuhmann/improved-aesthetic-predictor)).\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-3`](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-3): Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-2` - 195,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on \"laion-improved-aesthetics\" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-4`](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-2` - 225,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on \"laion-aesthetics v2 5+\" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-5`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-2` - 595,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on \"laion-aesthetics v2 5+\" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).\n- [`stable-diffusion-inpainting`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting) Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-5` - then 440,000 steps of inpainting training at resolution 512x512 on \u201claion-aesthetics v2 5+\u201d and 10% dropping of the text-conditioning. For inpainting, the UNet has 5 additional input channels (4 for the encoded masked-image and 1 for the mask itself) whose weights were zero-initialized after restoring the non-inpainting checkpoint. During training, we generate synthetic masks and in 25% mask everything.\n\n- **Hardware:** 32 x 8 x A100 GPUs\n- **Optimizer:** AdamW\n- **Gradient Accumulations**: 2\n- **Batch:** 32 x 8 x 2 x 4 = 2048\n- **Learning rate:** warmup to 0.0001 for 10,000 steps and then kept constant\n\n## Evaluation Results \nEvaluations with different classifier-free guidance scales (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,\n5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0) and 50 PNDM/PLMS sampling\nsteps show the relative improvements of the checkpoints:\n\n![pareto](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion/resolve/main/v1-1-to-v1-5.png)\n\nEvaluated using 50 PLMS steps and 10000 random prompts from the COCO2017 validation set, evaluated at 512x512 resolution.

Possible research areas and\ntasks include\n\n- Safe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content.\n- Probing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models.\n- Generation of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes.\n- Applications in educational or creative tools.\n- Research on generative models.\n\nExcluded uses are described below.\n\n ### Misuse, Malicious Use, and Out-of-Scope Use\n_Note: This section is taken from the [DALLE-MINI model card](https://huggingface.co/dalle-mini/dalle-mini), but applies in the same way to Stable Diffusion v1_.\n\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate images that create hostile or alienating environments for people. This includes generating images that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.\n\n#### Out-of-Scope Use\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n#### Misuse and Malicious Use\nUsing the model to generate content that is cruel to individuals is a misuse of this model. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Generating demeaning, dehumanizing, or otherwise harmful representations of people or their environments, cultures, religions, etc.\n- Intentionally promoting or propagating discriminatory content or harmful stereotypes.\n- Impersonating individuals without their consent.\n- Sexual content without consent of the people who might see it.\n- Mis- and disinformation\n- Representations of egregious violence and gore\n- Sharing of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\n- Sharing content that is an alteration of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\n\n## Limitations and Bias\n\n### Limitations\n\n- The model does not achieve perfect photorealism\n- The model cannot render legible text\n- The model does not perform well on more difficult tasks which involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to \u201cA red cube on top of a blue sphere\u201d\n- Faces and people in general may not be generated properly.\n- The model was trained mainly with English captions and will not work as well in other languages.\n- The autoencoding part of the model is lossy\n- The model was trained on a large-scale dataset\n  [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) which contains adult material\n  and is not fit for product use without additional safety mechanisms and\n  considerations.\n- No additional measures were used to deduplicate the dataset. As a result, we observe some degree of memorization for images that are duplicated in the training data.\n  The training data can be searched at [https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/](https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/) to possibly assist in the detection of memorized images.\n\n### Bias\n\nWhile the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases. \nStable Diffusion v1 was trained on subsets of [LAION-2B(en)](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), \nwhich consists of images that are primarily limited to English descriptions. \nTexts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for. \nThis affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Further, the \nability of the model to generate content with non-English prompts is significantly worse than with English-language prompts.\n\n### Safety Module\n\nThe intended use of this model is with the [Safety Checker](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable_diffusion/safety_checker.py) in Diffusers. \nThis checker works by checking model outputs against known hard-coded NSFW concepts.\nThe concepts are intentionally hidden to reduce the likelihood of reverse-engineering this filter.\nSpecifically, the checker compares the class probability of harmful concepts in the embedding space of the `CLIPTextModel` *after generation* of the images. \nThe concepts are passed into the model with the generated image and compared to a hand-engineered weight for each NSFW concept.\n\n\n## Training\n\n**Training Data**\nThe model developers used the following dataset for training the model:\n\n- LAION-2B (en) and subsets thereof (see next section)\n\n**Training Procedure**\nStable Diffusion v1-4 is a latent diffusion model which combines an autoencoder with a diffusion model that is trained in the latent space of the autoencoder. During training, \n\n- Images are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4\n- Text prompts are encoded through a ViT-L/14 text-encoder.\n- The non-pooled output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.\n- The loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet.\n\nWe currently provide four checkpoints, which were trained as follows.\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-1`](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-1): 237,000 steps at resolution `256x256` on [laion2B-en](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-en).\n  194,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on [laion-high-resolution](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion-high-resolution) (170M examples from LAION-5B with resolution `>= 1024x1024`).\n- [`stable-diffusion-v1-2`](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-2): Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-1`.\n  515,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on \"laion-improved-aesthetics\" (a subset of laion2B-en,\nfiltered to images with an original size `>= 512x512`, estimated aesthetics score `> 5.0`, and an estimated watermark probability `< 0.5`.

This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Generating demeaning, dehumanizing, or otherwise harmful representations of people or their environments, cultures, religions, etc.\n- Intentionally promoting or propagating discriminatory content or harmful stereotypes.\n- Impersonating individuals without their consent.\n- Sexual content without consent of the people who might see it.\n- Mis- and disinformation\n- Representations of egregious violence and gore\n- Sharing of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\n- Sharing content that is an alteration of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\n\n## Limitations and Bias\n\n### Limitations\n\n- The model does not achieve perfect photorealism\n- The model cannot render legible text\n- The model does not perform well on more difficult tasks which involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to \u201cA red cube on top of a blue sphere\u201d\n- Faces and people in general may not be generated properly.\n- The model was trained mainly with English captions and will not work as well in other languages.\n- The autoencoding part of the model is lossy\n- The model was trained on a subset of the large-scale dataset\n  [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), which contains adult, violent and sexual content. To partially mitigate this, we have filtered the dataset using LAION's NFSW detector (see Training section).\n\n### Bias\nWhile the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases. \nStable Diffusion was primarily trained on subsets of [LAION-2B(en)](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), \nwhich consists of images that are limited to English descriptions. \nTexts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for. \nThis affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Further, the \nability of the model to generate content with non-English prompts is significantly worse than with English-language prompts.\nStable Diffusion v2 mirrors and exacerbates biases to such a degree that viewer discretion must be advised irrespective of the input or its intent.\n\n\n## Training\n\n**Training Data**\nThe model developers used the following dataset for training the model:\n\n- LAION-5B and subsets (details below). The training data is further filtered using LAION's NSFW detector, with a \"p_unsafe\" score of 0.1 (conservative). For more details, please refer to LAION-5B's [NeurIPS 2022](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M3Y74vmsMcY) paper and reviewer discussions on the topic.\n\n**Training Procedure**\nStable Diffusion v2 is a latent diffusion model which combines an autoencoder with a diffusion model that is trained in the latent space of the autoencoder. During training, \n\n- Images are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4\n- Text prompts are encoded through the OpenCLIP-ViT/H text-encoder.\n- The output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.\n- The loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet. We also use the so-called _v-objective_, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512.\n\nWe currently provide the following checkpoints:\n\n- `512-base-ema.ckpt`: 550k steps at resolution `256x256` on a subset of [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) filtered for explicit pornographic material, using the [LAION-NSFW classifier](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLIP-based-NSFW-Detector) with `punsafe=0.1` and an [aesthetic score](https://github.com/christophschuhmann/improved-aesthetic-predictor) >= `4.5`.\n  850k steps at resolution `512x512` on the same dataset with resolution `>= 512x512`.\n- `768-v-ema.ckpt`: Resumed from `512-base-ema.ckpt` and trained for 150k steps using a [v-objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512) on the same dataset. Resumed for another 140k steps on a `768x768` subset of our dataset.\n- `512-depth-ema.ckpt`: Resumed from `512-base-ema.ckpt` and finetuned for 200k steps. Added an extra input channel to process the (relative) depth prediction produced by [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) (`dpt_hybrid`) which is used as an additional conditioning.\nThe additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized.\n- `512-inpainting-ema.ckpt`: Resumed from `512-base-ema.ckpt` and trained for another 200k steps. Follows the mask-generation strategy presented in [LAMA](https://github.com/saic-mdal/lama) which, in combination with the latent VAE representations of the masked image, are used as an additional conditioning.\nThe additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized. The same strategy was used to train the [1.5-inpainting checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting).\n- `x4-upscaling-ema.ckpt`: Trained for 1.25M steps on a 10M subset of LAION containing images `>2048x2048`. The model was trained on crops of size `512x512` and is a text-guided [latent upscaling diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752).\nIn addition to the textual input, it receives a `noise_level` as an input parameter, which can be used to add noise to the low-resolution input according to a [predefined diffusion schedule](configs/stable-diffusion/x4-upscaling.yaml). \n\n- **Hardware:** 32 x 8 x A100 GPUs\n- **Optimizer:** AdamW\n- **Gradient Accumulations**: 1\n- **Batch:** 32 x 8 x 2 x 4 = 2048\n- **Learning rate:** warmup to 0.0001 for 10,000 steps and then kept constant\n\n## Evaluation Results \nEvaluations with different classifier-free guidance scales (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,\n5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0) and 50 steps DDIM sampling steps show the relative improvements of the checkpoints:\n\n![pareto](model-variants.jpg) \n\nEvaluated using 50 DDIM steps and 10000 random prompts from the COCO2017 validation set, evaluated at 512x512 resolution.  Not optimized for FID scores.\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\n**Stable Diffusion v1** **Estimated Emissions**\nBased on that information, we estimate the following CO2 emissions using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700).

To partially mitigate this, we have filtered the dataset using LAION's NFSW detector (see Training section).\n\n### Bias\nWhile the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases. \nStable Diffusion was primarily trained on subsets of [LAION-2B(en)](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), \nwhich consists of images that are limited to English descriptions. \nTexts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for. \nThis affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Further, the \nability of the model to generate content with non-English prompts is significantly worse than with English-language prompts.\nStable Diffusion v2 mirrors and exacerbates biases to such a degree that viewer discretion must be advised irrespective of the input or its intent.\n\n\n## Training\n\n**Training Data**\nThe model developers used the following dataset for training the model:\n\n- LAION-5B and subsets (details below). The training data is further filtered using LAION's NSFW detector, with a \"p_unsafe\" score of 0.1 (conservative). For more details, please refer to LAION-5B's [NeurIPS 2022](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M3Y74vmsMcY) paper and reviewer discussions on the topic.\n\n**Training Procedure**\nStable Diffusion v2 is a latent diffusion model which combines an autoencoder with a diffusion model that is trained in the latent space of the autoencoder. During training, \n\n- Images are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4\n- Text prompts are encoded through the OpenCLIP-ViT/H text-encoder.\n- The output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.\n- The loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet. We also use the so-called _v-objective_, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512.\n\nWe currently provide the following checkpoints:\n\n- `512-base-ema.ckpt`: 550k steps at resolution `256x256` on a subset of [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) filtered for explicit pornographic material, using the [LAION-NSFW classifier](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLIP-based-NSFW-Detector) with `punsafe=0.1` and an [aesthetic score](https://github.com/christophschuhmann/improved-aesthetic-predictor) >= `4.5`.\n  850k steps at resolution `512x512` on the same dataset with resolution `>= 512x512`.\n- `768-v-ema.ckpt`: Resumed from `512-base-ema.ckpt` and trained for 150k steps using a [v-objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512) on the same dataset. Resumed for another 140k steps on a `768x768` subset of our dataset.\n- `512-depth-ema.ckpt`: Resumed from `512-base-ema.ckpt` and finetuned for 200k steps. Added an extra input channel to process the (relative) depth prediction produced by [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) (`dpt_hybrid`) which is used as an additional conditioning.\nThe additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized.\n- `512-inpainting-ema.ckpt`: Resumed from `512-base-ema.ckpt` and trained for another 200k steps. Follows the mask-generation strategy presented in [LAMA](https://github.com/saic-mdal/lama) which, in combination with the latent VAE representations of the masked image, are used as an additional conditioning.\nThe additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized. The same strategy was used to train the [1.5-inpainting checkpoint](https://github.com/saic-mdal/lama).\n- `x4-upscaling-ema.ckpt`: Trained for 1.25M steps on a 10M subset of LAION containing images `>2048x2048`. The model was trained on crops of size `512x512` and is a text-guided [latent upscaling diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752).\nIn addition to the textual input, it receives a `noise_level` as an input parameter, which can be used to add noise to the low-resolution input according to a [predefined diffusion schedule](configs/stable-diffusion/x4-upscaling.yaml). \n\n- **Hardware:** 32 x 8 x A100 GPUs\n- **Optimizer:** AdamW\n- **Gradient Accumulations**: 1\n- **Batch:** 32 x 8 x 2 x 4 = 2048\n- **Learning rate:** warmup to 0.0001 for 10,000 steps and then kept constant\n\n## Evaluation Results \nEvaluations with different classifier-free guidance scales (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,\n5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0) and 50 steps DDIM sampling steps show the relative improvements of the checkpoints:\n\n![pareto](model-variants.jpg) \n\nEvaluated using 50 DDIM steps and 10000 random prompts from the COCO2017 validation set, evaluated at 512x512 resolution.  Not optimized for FID scores.\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\n**Stable Diffusion v1** **Estimated Emissions**\nBased on that information, we estimate the following CO2 emissions using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700).

The watermark estimate is from the LAION-5B metadata, the aesthetics score is estimated using an [improved aesthetics estimator](https://github.com/christophschuhmann/improved-aesthetic-predictor)).\n- **stable-diffusion-v1-3**: The checkpoint resumed training from `stable-diffusion-v1-2`. 195,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on \"laion-improved-aesthetics\" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598)\n- **stable-diffusion-v1-4**: The checkpoint resumed training from `stable-diffusion-v1-2`. 195,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on \"laion-improved-aesthetics\" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).\n- [**`stable-diffusion-v1-4`**](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-2`.225,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on \"laion-aesthetics v2 5+\" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).\n\n### Model Access\n\nEach checkpoint can be used both with Hugging Face's [ \ud83e\udde8 Diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) or the original [Stable Diffusion GitHub repository](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion).

The intent was to fine-tune on the Stable Diffusion training set (the autoencoder was originally trained on OpenImages) but also enrich the dataset with images of humans to improve the reconstruction of faces.\nThe first, _ft-EMA_, was resumed from the original checkpoint, trained for 313198 steps and uses EMA weights. It uses the same loss configuration as the original checkpoint (L1 + LPIPS).\nThe second, _ft-MSE_, was resumed from _ft-EMA_ and uses EMA weights and was trained for another 280k steps using a different loss, with more emphasis \non MSE reconstruction (MSE + 0.1 * LPIPS). It produces somewhat ``smoother'' outputs.

result (**DDIM** kinda works too), CFG Scale 7, steps 20 should be fine\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```\nportrait of a girl in dgs illustration style, Anime girl, female soldier working in a cyberpunk city, cleavage, ((perfect femine face)), intricate, 8k, highly detailed, shy, digital painting, intense, sharp focus\n```\n\nFor cyber robot male character, you can add **muscular male** to improve the output.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n```\na photo of muscular beard soldier male in dgs illustration style, half-body, holding robot arms, strong chest\n```\n\n**Example 3 (with Stable Diffusion WebUI):**\n\nIf using [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)\n\nYou can simply use this as **prompt** with **Euler A** Sampler,  CFG Scale 7, steps 20, 704 x 704px output res:\n\n```\nan anime girl in dgs illustration style\n```\n\nAnd set the **negative prompt** as this to get cleaner face: \n\n```\nout of focus, scary, creepy, evil, disfigured, missing limbs, ugly, gross, missing fingers\n```\n\nThis will give you the exactly same style as the sample images above.\n\n<center><img

These spectrograms can be converted into audio clips.\n\nThe model was created by [Seth Forsgren](https://sethforsgren.com/) and [Hayk Martiros](https://haykmartiros.com/) as a hobby project.\n\nYou can use the Riffusion model directly, or try the [Riffusion web app](https://www.riffusion.com/).\n\nThe Riffusion model was created by fine-tuning the **Stable-Diffusion-v1-5** checkpoint. Read about Stable Diffusion here [\ud83e\udd17's Stable Diffusion blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion).\n\n### Model Details\n- **Developed by:** Seth Forsgren, Hayk Martiros\n- **Model type:** Diffusion-based text-to-image generation model\n- **Language(s):** English\n- **License:** [The CreativeML OpenRAIL M license](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license) is an [Open RAIL M license](https://www.licenses.ai/blog/2022/8/18/naming-convention-of-responsible-ai-licenses), adapted from the work that [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) and [the RAIL Initiative](https://www.licenses.ai/) are jointly carrying in the area of responsible AI licensing. See also [the article about the BLOOM Open RAIL license](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/the-bigscience-rail-license) on which our license is based.\n- **Model Description:** This is a model that can be used to generate and modify images based on text prompts. It is a [Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752) that uses a fixed, pretrained text encoder ([CLIP ViT-L/14](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020)) as suggested in the [Imagen paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487).\n\n### Direct Use \nThe model is intended for research purposes only. Possible research areas and\ntasks include\n\n- Generation of artworks, audio, and use in creative processes.\n- Applications in educational or creative tools.\n- Research on generative models.\n\n### Datasets\nThe original Stable Diffusion v1.5 was trained on the [LAION-5B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08402) dataset using the [CLIP text encoder](https://openai.com/blog/clip/), which provided an amazing starting point with an in-depth understanding of language, including musical concepts. The team at LAION also compiled a fantastic audio dataset from many general, speech, and music sources that we recommend at [LAION-AI/audio-dataset](https://github.com/LAION-AI/audio-dataset/blob/main/data_collection/README.md).\n\n### Fine Tuning\n\nCheck out the [diffusers training examples](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/overview) from Hugging Face. Fine tuning requires a dataset of spectrogram images of short audio clips, with associated text describing them. Note that the CLIP encoder is able to understand and connect many words even if they never appear in the dataset. It is also possible to use a [dreambooth](https://huggingface.co/blog/dreambooth) method to get custom styles.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you build on this work, please cite it as follows:\n\n```\n@article{Forsgren_Martiros_2022,\n  author = {Forsgren, Seth* and Martiros, Hayk*},\n  title = {{Riffusion - Stable diffusion for real-time music generation}},\n  url = {https://riffusion.com/about},\n  year = {2022}\n}\n```\n", "lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers": "\n\n# Stable Diffusion Image Variations Model Card\n\n\ud83d\udce3 V2 model released, and blurriness issues fixed! \ud83d\udce3\n\n\ud83e\udde8\ud83c\udf89 Image Variations is now natively supported in \ud83e\udd17 Diffusers! \ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udde8\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinpinkney/stable-diffusion/main/assets/im-vars-thin.jpg)\n\n## Version 2\n\nThis version of Stable Diffusion has been fine tuned from [CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4-original](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original) to accept CLIP image embedding rather than text embeddings. This allows the creation of \"image variations\" similar to DALLE-2 using Stable Diffusion. This version of the weights has been ported to huggingface Diffusers, to use this with the Diffusers library requires the [Lambda Diffusers repo](https://github.com/LambdaLabsML/lambda-diffusers).\n\nThis model was trained in two stages and longer than the original variations model and gives better image quality and better CLIP rated similarity compared to the original version\n\nSee training details and v1 vs v2 comparison below.\n\n\n## Example\n\nMake sure you are using a version of Diffusers >=0.8.0 (for older version see the old instructions at the bottom of this model card)\n\n```python\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionImageVariationPipeline\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndevice = \"cuda:0\"\nsd_pipe = StableDiffusionImageVariationPipeline.from_pretrained(\n  \"lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers\",\n  revision=\"v2.0\",\n  )\nsd_pipe = sd_pipe.to(device)\n\nim = Image.open(\"path/to/image.jpg\")\ntform = transforms.Compose([\n    transforms.ToTensor(),\n    transforms.Resize(\n        (224, 224),\n        interpolation=transforms.InterpolationMode.BICUBIC,\n        antialias=False,\n        ),\n    transforms.Normalize(\n      [0.48145466, 0.4578275, 0.40821073],\n      [0.26862954, 0.26130258, 0.27577711]),\n])\ninp = tform(im).to(device).unsqueeze(0)\n\nout = sd_pipe(inp, guidance_scale=3)\nout[\"images\"][0].save(\"result.jpg\")\n```\n\n### The importance of resizing correctly... (or not)\n\nNote that due a bit of an oversight during training, the model expects resized images without anti-aliasing. This turns out to make a big difference and is important to do the resizing the same way during inference. When passing a PIL image to the Diffusers pipeline antialiasing will be applied during resize, so it's better to input a tensor which you have prepared manually according to the transfrom in the example above!\n\nHere are examples of images generated without (top) and with (bottom) anti-aliasing during resize. (Input is [this image](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Versatile-Diffusion/blob/master/assets/ghibli.jpg))\n\n![](alias-montage.jpg)\n\n![](default-montage.jpg)\n\n### V1 vs V2\n\nHere's an example of V1 vs V2, version two was trained more carefully and for longer, see the details below. V2-top vs V1-bottom\n\n![](v2-montage.jpg)\n\n![](v1-montage.jpg)\n\nInput images:\n\n![](inputs.jpg)\n\nOne important thing to note is that due to the longer training V2 appears to have memorised some common images from the training data, e.g. now the previous example of the Girl with a Pearl Earring almosts perfectly reproduce the original rather than creating variations. You can always use v1 by specifiying `revision=\"v1.0\"`.\n\nv2 output for girl with a pearl earing as input (guidance scale=3)\n\n![](earring.jpg)\n\n# Training\n\n\n**Training Procedure**\nThis model is fine tuned from Stable Diffusion v1-3 where the text encoder has been replaced with an image encoder.

In this example, we train a lightweight deep network, DCE-Net, to estimate pixel-wise and high-order tonal curves for dynamic range adjustment of a given image.\n\nZero-DCE takes a low-light image as input and produces high-order tonal curves as its output. These curves are then used for pixel-wise adjustment on the dynamic range of the input to obtain an enhanced image. The curve estimation process is done in such a way that it maintains the range of the enhanced image and preserves the contrast of neighboring pixels. This curve estimation is inspired by curves adjustment used in photo editing software such as Adobe Photoshop where users can adjust points throughout an image\u2019s tonal range.\n\nZero-DCE is appealing because of its relaxed assumptions with regard to reference images: it does not require any input/output image pairs during training. This is achieved through a set of carefully formulated non-reference loss functions, which implicitly measure the enhancement quality and guide the training of the network.\n\n\nSample Images:\n\n<img

This allows the creation of \"image variations\" similar to DALLE-2 using Stable Diffusion. This version of the weights has been ported to huggingface Diffusers, to use this with the Diffusers library requires the [Lambda Diffusers repo](https://github.com/LambdaLabsML/lambda-diffusers).\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinpinkney/stable-diffusion/main/assets/im-vars-thin.jpg)\n\n## Example\n\nFirst clone [Lambda Diffusers](https://github.com/LambdaLabsML/lambda-diffusers) and install any requirements (in a virtual environment in the example below):\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/LambdaLabsML/lambda-diffusers.git\ncd lambda-diffusers\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nThen run the following python code:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom lambda_diffusers import StableDiffusionImageEmbedPipeline\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport torch\n\ndevice = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\npipe = StableDiffusionImageEmbedPipeline.from_pretrained(\"lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers\")\npipe = pipe.to(device)\n\nim = Image.open(\"your/input/image/here.jpg\")\nnum_samples = 4\nimage = pipe(num_samples*[im], guidance_scale=3.0)\nimage = image[\"sample\"]\n\nbase_path = Path(\"outputs/im2im\")\nbase_path.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)\nfor idx, im in enumerate(image):\n    im.save(base_path/f\"{idx:06}.jpg\")\n```\n\n\n# Training\n\n**Training Data**\nThe model developers used the following dataset for training the model:\n\n- LAION-2B (en) and subsets thereof (see next section)\n\n**Training Procedure**\nThis model is fine tuned from Stable Diffusion v1-3 where the text encoder has been replaced with an image encoder. The training procedure is the same as for Stable Diffusion except for the fact that images are encoded through a ViT-L/14 image-encoder including the final projection layer to the CLIP shared embedding space.\n\n- **Hardware:** 4 x A6000 GPUs (provided by [Lambda GPU Cloud](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud))\n- **Optimizer:** AdamW\n- **Gradient Accumulations**: 1\n- **Steps**: 87,000\n- **Batch:** 6 x 4 = 24\n- **Learning rate:** warmup to 0.0001 for 1,000 steps and then kept constant\n\nTraining was done using a [modified version of the original Stable Diffusion training code]((https://github.com/justinpinkney/stable-diffusion), the original version of the weights is [here](https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/stable-diffusion-image-conditioned).\n\n\n# Uses\n_The following section is adapted from the [Stable Diffusion model card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)_\n\n## Direct Use \nThe model is intended for research purposes only. Possible research areas and\ntasks include\n\n- Safe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content.\n- Probing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models.\n- Generation of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes.\n- Applications in educational or creative tools.\n- Research on generative models.\n\nExcluded uses are described below.\n\n ### Misuse, Malicious Use, and Out-of-Scope Use\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate images that create hostile or alienating environments for people. This includes generating images that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.\n\n#### Out-of-Scope Use\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n#### Misuse and Malicious Use\nUsing the model to generate content that is cruel to individuals is a misuse of this model. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Generating demeaning, dehumanizing, or otherwise harmful representations of people or their environments, cultures, religions, etc.\n- Intentionally promoting or propagating discriminatory content or harmful stereotypes.\n- Impersonating individuals without their consent.\n- Sexual content without consent of the people who might see it.\n- Mis- and disinformation\n- Representations of egregious violence and gore\n- Sharing of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\n- Sharing content that is an alteration of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.\n\n## Limitations and Bias\n\n### Limitations\n\n- The model does not achieve perfect photorealism\n- The model cannot render legible text\n- The model does not perform well on more difficult tasks which involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to \u201cA red cube on top of a blue sphere\u201d\n- Faces and people in general may not be generated properly.\n- The model was trained mainly with English captions and will not work as well in other languages.\n- The autoencoding part of the model is lossy\n- The model was trained on a large-scale dataset\n  [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) which contains adult material\n  and is not fit for product use without additional safety mechanisms and\n  considerations.\n- No additional measures were used to deduplicate the dataset. As a result, we observe some degree of memorization for images that are duplicated in the training data.\n  The training data can be searched at [https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/](https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/) to possibly assist in the detection of memorized images.\n\n### Bias\n\nWhile the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases. \nStable Diffusion v1 was trained on subsets of [LAION-2B(en)](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), \nwhich consists of images that are primarily limited to English descriptions. \nTexts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for. \nThis affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Further, the \nability of the model to generate content with non-English prompts is significantly worse than with English-language prompts.\n\n### Safety Module\n\nThe intended use of this model is with the [Safety Checker](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable_diffusion/safety_checker.py) in Diffusers. \nThis checker works by checking model outputs against known hard-coded NSFW concepts.\nThe concepts are intentionally hidden to reduce the likelihood of reverse-engineering this filter.\nSpecifically, the checker compares the class probability of harmful concepts in the embedding space of the `CLIPModel` *after generation* of the images. \nThe concepts are passed into the model with the generated image and compared to a hand-engineered weight for each NSFW concept.\n\n\n*This model card was written by: Justin Pinkney and is based on the [Stable Diffusion model card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4).*", "sivar/legostyle1-5": "\n### LegoStyle1.5 Dreambooth model trained with [TheLastBen's fast-DreamBooth](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast-DreamBooth.ipynb) notebook\n\n\nThis is the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on lego set images.\nUse the tokens **_LegoStyle style_** in your prompts for the effect.\n\n\nTest the concept via A1111 Colab [fast-Colab-A1111](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast_stable_diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.ipynb)\n\n\n\n\nSample pictures of this concept img-to-img:\n\n\n\n![joind3.jpg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1673630119515-6387323e5c68cf2713b75239.jpeg)\n\n```\nPositive: LegoStyle style, smooth objects, high resolution\nNegative: curve, circle, blurry, drawing, cartoon illustration\n```\n\n### \ud83e\udde8 Diffusers\n\nThis model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model.

unpaired image-to-image translation. \n\n## Model description  \n\nCycleGAN for unpaired image-to-image translation.   \nGiven two image domains A and B, the following components are trained end2end to translate between such domains:   \n- A generator A to B, named G_AB conditioned on an image from A   \n- A generator B to A, named G_BA conditioned on an image from B   \n- A domain classifier D_A, associated with G_AB   \n- A domain classifier D_B, associated with G_BA    \n\n\nAt inference time, G_AB or G_BA are relevant to translate images, respectively A to B or  B to A.  \nIn the general setting, this technique provides style transfer functionalities between the selected image domains A and B.   \nThis allows to obtain a generated translation by G_AB, of an image from domain A that resembles the distribution of the images from domain B, and viceversa for the generator G_BA.  \nUnder these framework, these aspects have been used to perform style transfer between synthetic data obtained from a simulated driving dataset, GTA5, and the real driving data from Cityscapes.   \nThis is of paramount importance to develop autonomous driving perception deep learning models, as this allows to generate synthetic data with automatic annotations which resembles real world images, without requiring the intervention of a human annotator.  \nThis is fundamental because a manual annotator has been shown to require 1.5 to 3.3 hours to create semantic and instance segmentation masks for a single images.  \nThese have been provided in the original [cityscapes paper (Cordts et al 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13395) and the [adverse condition dataset (Sakaridis et al. 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13395) paper.    \n\n  \nHence the CycleGAN provides forward and backward translation between synthetic and real world data.   \nThis has showed to allows high quality translation even in absence of paired sample-ground-truth data.  \nThe idea behind such model is that as the synthetic data distribution gets closer to the real world one, deep models do not suffer from degraded performance due to the domain shift issue.   \nA broad literature is available on the minimization of the domain shift, under the research branch of domain adaptation and transfer learning, of which image translation models provide an alternative approach\n\n\n## Intended uses &

   \n```\n\n\n\n#### Limitations and bias\n\nDue to the absence of paired data, some background parts of the synthetic images are seldom wrongly translated, e.g. sky is translated to vegetation.   \nAdditional pretext tasks in parallel to the discriminative classifier of fake and real samples could improve the result.  \nOne easy improvement is the use of an additional parallel branch that performs semantic segmentation on the synthetic data, in order to learn features which are common to sky and vegetation, thus disentangling their representations as separate classes.    \n\n## Training data\n\n\nThe CycleGAN model is trained on an unpaired dataset of samples from synthetic and real driving data, respectively from the GTA5 and Cityscapes datasets.   \nTo this end, the synthetic-to-real dataset can be loaded by means of the function load_dataset in the huggingface library, as follows.\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nunpaired_dataset = load_dataset(\"huggan/sim2real_gta5_to_cityscapes\")\n\n```\nThis dataset contains two columns, imageA and imageB representing respectively the GTA5 and Cityscapes data.  \nDue to the fact that the two columns have to be of the same length, GTA5 is subsampled in order to reach the same number of samples provided by the Cityscapes train split (2975)\n\n\n## Training procedure\n#### Preprocessing\nThe following transformations are applied to each input sample of synthetic and real data.   \nThe input size is fixed to RGB images of height, width = 512, 512.\nThis choice has been made in order to limit the impact of upsampling the translated images to higher resolutions.\n```python\nn_channels = 3\nimage_size = 512\ninput_shape = (image_size, image_size)\n\ntransform = Compose([\n    T.ToPILImage(),\n    T.Resize(input_shape),\n    ToTensor(),\n    Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)),\n])\n```\n\n#### Hardware  \nThe configuration has been tested on single GPU setup on a RTX5000 and A5000, as well as multi-gpu single-rank distributed setups composed of 2 of the mentioned GPUs.\n\n#### Hyperparameters\nThe following configuration has been kept fixed for all translation models:   \n- learning rate 0.0002   \n- number of epochs 200\n- learning rate decay activation at epoch 100\n- number of residual blocks of the cyclegan 9\n- image size 512x512\n-

Typically, the random input is sampled from a normal distribution, before going through a series of transformations that turn it into something plausible (image, video, audio, etc.).\n\nHowever, a simple DCGAN doesn't let us control the appearance (e.g. class) of the samples we're generating. For instance, with a GAN that generates MNIST handwritten digits, a simple DCGAN wouldn't let us choose the class of digits we're generating. To be able to control what we generate, we need to condition the GAN output on a semantic input, such as the class of an image.\n\nIn this example, we'll build a Conditional GAN that can generate MNIST handwritten digits conditioned on a given class. Such a model can have various useful applications:\n\nlet's say you are dealing with an imbalanced image dataset, and you'd like to gather more examples for the skewed class to balance the dataset. Data collection can be a costly process on its own. You could instead train a Conditional GAN and use it to generate novel images for the class that needs balancing.\nSince the generator learns to associate the generated samples with the class labels, its representations can also be used for other downstream tasks.", "kunheekim/style-aware-discriminator": "\n\n# Style-Aware Discriminator\n\nPre-trained weights for [A Style-Aware Discriminator for Controllable Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15375).\n\nPlease check the [official repository](https://github.com/kunheek/style-aware-discriminator) for more details.\n\n\n# Citation\n```sh\n@InProceedings{kim2022style,\n  title={A Style-Aware Discriminator for Controllable Image Translation},\n  author={Kim, Kunhee and Park, Sanghun and Jeon, Eunyeong and Kim, Taehun and Kim, Daijin},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},\n  year={2022},\n  pages={18239--18248}\n}\n```", "weitf/muscleAmine": "\n\na hyper network trained by \u3088\u3057\u7537's artwork.\n\n(reference: https://www.pixiv.net/users/3584828)\n\nonly for study and self use\n\nplease do not publish or use for business.\n\n\u8bf7\u52ff\u53d1\u8868\u6216\u5546\u7528\n\nAuthor: Tongfan Wei (weitf@bu.edu)\n\nan example by base model anything v4.5, upscale model CUGAN\n\n![00681-3567241462-NSFW, (master___.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1676775176386-63458d7f547c70e4b7cd5d40.png)", "google/maxim-s2-deraining-raindrop": "\n\n# MAXIM pre-trained on Raindrop for image deraining \n\nMAXIM model pre-trained for image deraining.

image domains A and B, the following components are trained end2end to translate between such domains:   \n- A generator A to B, named G_AB conditioned on an image from A   \n- A generator B to A, named G_BA conditioned on an image from B   \n- A domain classifier D_A, associated with G_AB   \n- A domain classifier D_B, associated with G_BA    \n\n\nAt inference time, G_AB or G_BA are relevant to translate images, respectively A to B or  B to A.  \nIn the general setting, this technique provides style transfer functionalities between the selected image domains A and B.   \nThis allows to obtain a generated translation by G_AB, of an image from domain A that resembles the distribution of the images from domain B, and viceversa for the generator G_BA.  \nUnder these framework, these aspects have been used to perform style transfer between NFT collections.   \nA collection is selected as domain A, another one as domain B and the CycleGAN provides forward and backward translation between A and B.   \nThis has showed to allows high quality translation even in absence of paired sample-ground-truth data.  \nIn particular, the model performs well with stationary backgrounds (no drastic texture changes in the appearance of backgrounds) as it is capable of recognizing the attributes of each of the elements of an NFT collections.  \nAn attribute can be a variation in type of dressed fashion items such as sunglasses, earrings, clothes and also face or body attributes with respect to a common template model of the given NFT collection).    \n\n\n## Intended uses &

The architecture of this model alongside with training techniques like model weights ensembling can reach or outperform state-of-the-art results on standard Document Binarization Competition (DIBCO) datasets in the both machine-printed and handwritten documents.\n\n\n\n## Direct Use\n\n<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->\n<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say \"more info needed.\" -->\n\nThe intended use is the binarization of document images, particularly of historical documents, understood as one of the main pre-processing steps for text recognition.\n\n\n## Downstream Use\n\n<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->\n<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say \"more info needed.\" -->\n \nA possible downstream use of this model might lie with the binarization of illustrative elements contained in document images such as digitized newspapers, magazines or books. In such cases, binarization might support analysis of creator attribution, artistic style (e.g., in line drawings), or analysis of image similarity. Furthermore, the model can be used or trained for any other image enhancement use cases too.\n\n\n## Out-of-Scope Use\n\n<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->\n<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say \"more info needed.\" -->\n\nThis model does **NOT** perform any Optical Character Recognition (OCR), it is an image-to-image model only.\n\n\n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\n<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->\n\nThe aim of the development of this model was to improve document image binarization as a necessary pre-processing step. Since the content of the document images is not touched, ethical challenges cannot be identified. The endeavor of developing the model was not undertaken for profit; though a product based on this model might be developed in the future, it will always remain openly accessible without any commercial interest. \nThis algorithm performs a pixelwise segmentation which is done in patches. Therefore, one technical limitation of this model is that it is unable to capture and see long range dependencies.\n\n\n## Recommendations\n\n<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->\n\nThe application of machine learning models to convert a document image into a binary output is a process which can still be improved. We have used many pseudo-labeled images to train our model, so any improvement or ground truth extension would probably lead to better results.\n\n\n# Training Details\n\n## Training Data\n\n<!-- This should link to a Data Card, perhaps with a short stub of information on what the training data is all about as well as documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering. -->\nThe dataset used for training is a combination of training sets from previous [DIBCO](https://dib.cin.ufpe.br/#!/datasets) binarization competitions alongside with the [Palm Leaf dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7814130) and the Persian Heritage Image Binarization Competition [PHIBC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6263) dataset, with additional pseudo-labeled images from the Berlin State Library (SBB; datasets to be published). Furthermore, a dataset for very dark or very bright images has been produced for training.\n\n\n## Training Procedure\n\n<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications. Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->\n\nWe have used a batch size of 8 with learning rate of 1e \u2212 4 for 20 epochs.

The model is trained using \"teacher forcing\" on a lot of (image, text) pairs.\n\nThe goal for the model is simply to predict the next text token, giving the image tokens and previous text tokens.\n\nThe model has full access to (i.e. a bidirectional attention mask is used for) the image patch tokens, but only has access to the previous text tokens (i.e. a causal attention mask is used for the text tokens) when predicting the next text token.\n\n![GIT architecture](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/git_architecture.jpg)\n\nThis allows the model to be used for tasks like:\n\n- image and video captioning\n- visual question answering (VQA) on images and videos\n- even image classification (by simply conditioning the model on the image and asking it to generate a class for it in text).\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for visual question answering (VQA). See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=microsoft/git) to look for\nfine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\nFor code examples, we refer to the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main/model_doc/git.html).\n\n## Training data\n\nFrom the paper:\n\n> We collect 0.8B image-text pairs for pre-training, which include COCO (Lin et al., 2014), Conceptual Captions\n(CC3M) (Sharma et al., 2018), SBU (Ordonez et al., 2011), Visual Genome (VG) (Krishna et al., 2016),\nConceptual Captions (CC12M) (Changpinyo et al., 2021), ALT200M (Hu et al., 2021a), and an extra 0.6B\ndata following a similar collection procedure in Hu et al. (2021a).\n\n=> however this is for the model referred to as \"GIT\" in the paper, which is not open-sourced.\n\nThis checkpoint is \"GIT-large\", which is a smaller variant of GIT trained on 20 million image-text pairs.\n\nNext, the model was fine-tuned on TextVQA.\n\nSee table 11 in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14100) for more details.\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nWe refer to the original repo regarding details for preprocessing during training.\n\nDuring validation, one resizes the shorter edge of each image, after which center cropping is performed to a fixed-size resolution. Next, frames are normalized across the RGB channels with the ImageNet mean and standard deviation.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nFor evaluation results, we refer readers to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14100).", "tufa15nik/vilt-finetuned-vqasi": "Entry not found", "azwierzc/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa-pl": "Entry not found", "Bingsu/temp_vilt_vqa": "Entry not found", "hf-tiny-model-private/tiny-random-ViltForQuestionAnswering": "Entry not found", "sheldonxxxx/OFA_model_weights": "\n\nThis is an unoffical mirror of the model weights for use with https://github.com/OFA-Sys/OFA\n\nThe original link is too slow when downloading from outside of China...", "impira/layoutlm-document-qa": "\n\n# LayoutLM for Visual Question Answering\n\nThis is a fine-tuned version of the multi-modal [LayoutLM](https://aka.ms/layoutlm) model for the task of question answering on documents.

It was introduced in the paper [End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872) by Carion et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing DETR did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nThe DETR model is an encoder-decoder transformer with a convolutional backbone. Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. \n\nThe model is trained using a \"bipartite matching loss\": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a \"no object\" as class and \"no bounding box\" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.\n\nDETR can be naturally extended to perform panoptic segmentation, by adding a mask head on top of the decoder outputs.\n\n![model image](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/detr_architecture.png)\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for panoptic segmentation. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=facebook/detr) to look for all available DETR models.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model:\n\n```python\nimport io\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport torch\nimport numpy\n\nfrom transformers import DetrFeatureExtractor, DetrForSegmentation\nfrom transformers.models.detr.feature_extraction_detr import rgb_to_id\n\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nfeature_extractor = DetrFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"facebook/detr-resnet-50-panoptic\")\nmodel = DetrForSegmentation.from_pretrained(\"facebook/detr-resnet-50-panoptic\")\n\n# prepare image for the model\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# forward pass\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# use the `post_process_panoptic` method of `DetrFeatureExtractor` to convert to COCO format\nprocessed_sizes = torch.as_tensor(inputs[\"pixel_values\"].shape[-2:]).unsqueeze(0)\nresult = feature_extractor.post_process_panoptic(outputs, processed_sizes)[0]\n\n# the segmentation is stored in a special-format png\npanoptic_seg = Image.open(io.BytesIO(result[\"png_string\"]))\npanoptic_seg = numpy.array(panoptic_seg, dtype=numpy.uint8)\n# retrieve the ids corresponding to each mask\npanoptic_seg_id = rgb_to_id(panoptic_seg)\n```\n\nCurrently, both the feature extractor and model support PyTorch. \n\n## Training data\n\nThe DETR model was trained on [COCO 2017 panoptic](https://cocodataset.org/#download), a dataset consisting of 118k/5k annotated images for training/validation respectively. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe exact details of preprocessing of images during training/validation can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr/blob/master/datasets/coco_panoptic.py). \n\nImages are resized/rescaled such that the shortest side is at least 800 pixels and the largest side at most 1333 pixels, and normalized across the RGB channels with the ImageNet mean (0.485, 0.456, 0.406) and standard deviation (0.229, 0.224, 0.225).\n\n### Training\n\nThe model was trained for 300 epochs on 16 V100 GPUs. This takes 3 days, with 4 images per GPU (hence a total batch size of 64).\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nThis model achieves the following results on COCO 2017 validation: a box AP (average precision) of **38.8**, a segmentation AP (average precision) of **31.1** and a PQ (panoptic quality) of **43.4**.\n\nFor more details regarding evaluation results, we refer to table 5 of the original paper.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2005-12872,\n  author    = {Nicolas Carion and\n               Francisco Massa and\n               Gabriel Synnaeve and\n               Nicolas Usunier and\n               Alexander Kirillov and\n               Sergey Zagoruyko},\n  title     = {End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/2005.12872},\n  year      = {2020},\n  url       = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprint    = {2005.12872},\n  timestamp = {Thu, 28 May 2020 17:38:09 +0200},\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2005-12872.bib},\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n```", "nvidia/segformer-b0-finetuned-ade-512-512": "\n\n# SegFormer (b0-sized) model fine-tuned on ADE20k\n\nSegFormer model fine-tuned on ADE20k at resolution 512x512.

But what if we want to know about the shape of the image? Segmentation models helps us segment images and reveal their shapes. It has many variants, including, panoptic segmentation, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation.This post is on hosting your Keras semantic segmentation models on Hub.\nSemantic segmentation models classify pixels, meaning, they assign a class (can be cat or dog) to each pixel. The output of a model looks like following.\n![Raw Output](./raw_output.jpg)\nWe need to get the best prediction for every pixel.\n![Mask](./mask.jpg)\nThis is still not readable. We have to convert this into different binary masks for each class and convert to a readable format by converting each mask into base64. We will return a list of dicts, and for each dictionary, we have the label itself, the base64 code and a score (semantic segmentation models don't return a score, so we have to return 1.0 for this case). You can find the full implementation in ```pipeline.py```.\n![Binary Mask](./binary_mask.jpg)\nNow that you know the expected output by the model, you can host your Keras segmentation models (and other semantic segmentation models) in the similar fashion.

It was introduced in the paper [End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872) by Carion et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr). \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing DETR did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nThe DETR model is an encoder-decoder transformer with a convolutional backbone. Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. \n\nThe model is trained using a \"bipartite matching loss\": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a \"no object\" as class and \"no bounding box\" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.\n\nDETR can be naturally extended to perform panoptic segmentation, by adding a mask head on top of the decoder outputs.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for panoptic segmentation. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=facebook/detr) to look for all available DETR models.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DetrFeatureExtractor, DetrForSegmentation\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nfeature_extractor = DetrFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('facebook/detr-resnet-101-panoptic')\nmodel = DetrForSegmentation.from_pretrained('facebook/detr-resnet-101-panoptic')\n\n# prepare inputs for the model\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# forward pass\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# use the `post_process_panoptic` method of `DetrFeatureExtractor` to convert to COCO format\nprocessed_sizes = torch.as_tensor(inputs[\"pixel_values\"].shape[-2:]).unsqueeze(0)\nresult = feature_extractor.post_process_panoptic(outputs, processed_sizes)[0]\n\n# the segmentation is stored in a special-format png\npanoptic_seg = Image.open(io.BytesIO(result[\"png_string\"]))\npanoptic_seg = numpy.array(panoptic_seg, dtype=numpy.uint8)\n# retrieve the ids corresponding to each mask\npanoptic_seg_id = rgb_to_id(panoptic_seg)\n```\n\nCurrently, both the feature extractor and model support PyTorch. \n\n## Training data\n\nThe DETR model was trained on [COCO 2017 panoptic](https://cocodataset.org/#download), a dataset consisting of 118k/5k annotated images for training/validation respectively. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe exact details of preprocessing of images during training/validation can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr/blob/master/datasets/coco_panoptic.py). \n\nImages are resized/rescaled such that the shortest side is at least 800 pixels and the largest side at most 1333 pixels, and normalized across the RGB channels with the ImageNet mean (0.485, 0.456, 0.406) and standard deviation (0.229, 0.224, 0.225).\n\n### Training\n\nThe model was trained for 300 epochs on 16 V100 GPUs.

It was introduced in the paper [BEIT: BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08254) by Hangbo Bao, Li Dong and Furu Wei and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/beit). \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing BEiT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nThe BEiT model is a Vision Transformer (ViT), which is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like). In contrast to the original ViT model, BEiT is pretrained on a large collection of images in a self-supervised fashion, namely ImageNet-21k, at a resolution of 224x224 pixels. The pre-training objective for the model is to predict visual tokens from the encoder of OpenAI's DALL-E's VQ-VAE, based on masked patches.\nNext, the model was fine-tuned in a supervised fashion on ImageNet (also referred to as ILSVRC2012), a dataset comprising 1 million images and 1,000 classes, also at resolution 224x224.\n\nImages are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. Contrary to the original ViT models, BEiT models do use relative position embeddings (similar to T5) instead of absolute position embeddings, and perform classification of images by mean-pooling the final hidden states of the patches, instead of placing a linear layer on top of the final hidden state of the [CLS] token.\n\nBy pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: for semantic segmentation, one can just add one of the decode heads available in the [mmseg library](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) for example, and fine-tune the model in a supervised fashion on annotated images. This is what the authors did: they fine-tuned BEiT with an UperHead segmentation decode head, allowing it to obtain SOTA results on important benchmarks such as ADE20k and CityScapes.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for semantic segmentation of images.

The license used is [Apple sample code license](https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing MobileViT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nMobileViT is a light-weight, low latency convolutional neural network that combines MobileNetV2-style layers with a new block that replaces local processing in convolutions with global processing using transformers. As with ViT (Vision Transformer), the image data is converted into flattened patches before it is processed by the transformer layers. Afterwards, the patches are \"unflattened\" back into feature maps. This allows the MobileViT-block to be placed anywhere inside a CNN. MobileViT does not require any positional embeddings.\n\nThe model in this repo adds a [DeepLabV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05587) head to the MobileViT backbone for semantic segmentation.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for semantic segmentation. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=mobilevit) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import MobileViTFeatureExtractor, MobileViTForSemanticSegmentation\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nfeature_extractor = MobileViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"apple/deeplabv3-mobilevit-xx-small\")\nmodel = MobileViTForSemanticSegmentation.from_pretrained(\"apple/deeplabv3-mobilevit-xx-small\")\n\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\npredicted_mask = logits.argmax(1).squeeze(0)\n```\n\nCurrently, both the feature extractor and model support PyTorch.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe MobileViT + DeepLabV3 model was pretrained on [ImageNet-1k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k), a dataset consisting of 1 million images and 1,000 classes, and then fine-tuned on the [PASCAL VOC2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) dataset.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nAt inference time, images are center-cropped at 512x512. Pixels are normalized to the range [0, 1]. Images are expected to be in BGR pixel order, not RGB.\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe MobileViT networks are trained from scratch for 300 epochs on ImageNet-1k on 8 NVIDIA GPUs with an effective batch size of 1024 and learning rate warmup for 3k steps, followed by cosine annealing. Also used were label smoothing cross-entropy loss and L2 weight decay. Training resolution varies from 160x160 to 320x320, using multi-scale sampling.\n\nTo obtain the DeepLabV3 model, MobileViT was fine-tuned on the PASCAL VOC dataset using 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\n| Model             | PASCAL VOC mIOU | # params  | URL                                                       |\n|", "nvidia/segformer-b5-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024": "\n\n# SegFormer (b5-sized) model fine-tuned on CityScapes\n\nSegFormer model fine-tuned on CityScapes at resolution 1024x1024.

We will return a list of dicts, and for each dictionary, we have the label itself, the base64 code and a score (semantic segmentation models don't return a score, so we have to return 1.0 for this case).

It supports self-supervised training, so it can be conveniently adapted in the field with no training data. \r\n 3. It's a stereo depth model, which means it's capable of high accuracy.\r\n \r\n The MADNet weights in this repository were trained using a Tensorflow 2 / Keras implementation of the original code. The model was created using the Keras Functional API, which enables the following features:\r\n 1. Good optimization. \r\n 2. High level Keras methods (.fit, .predict and .evaluate).\r\n 3. Little boilerplate code.\r\n 4. Decent support from external packages (like Weights and Biases). \r\n 5. Callbacks.\r\n \r\n The weights provided were either trained on the 2012 / 2015 kitti stereo dataset or flyingthings-3d dataset. The weights of the pretrained models from the original paper (tf1_conversion_kitti.h5 and tf1_conversion_synthetic.h5) are provided in tensorflow 2 format. The TF1 weights help speed up fine-tuning, but its recommended to use either synthetic.h5 (trained on flyingthings-3d) or kitti.h5 (trained on 2012 and 2015 kitti stereo datasets).\r\n\r\n**Abstract**:\r\n\r\nDeep convolutional neural networks trained end-to-end are the undisputed state-of-the-art methods to regress dense disparity maps directly from stereo pairs. However, such methods suffer from notable accuracy drops when exposed to scenarios significantly different from those seen in the training phase (e.g.real vs synthetic images, indoor vs outdoor, etc). As it is unlikely to be able to gather enough samples to achieve effective training/ tuning in any target domain, we propose to perform unsupervised and continuous online adaptation of a deep stereo network in order to preserve its accuracy independently of the sensed environment. However, such a strategy can be extremely demanding regarding computational resources and thus not enabling real-time performance. Therefore, we address this side effect by introducing a new lightweight, yet effective, deep stereo architecture Modularly ADaptive Network (MADNet) and by developing Modular ADaptation (MAD), an algorithm to train independently only sub-portions of our model. By deploying MADNet together with MAD we propose the first ever realtime self-adaptive deep stereo system.\r\n\r\n## Usage Instructions\r\nSee the accompanying codes readme for details on how to perform training and inferencing with the model: [madnet-deep-stereo-with-keras](https://github.com/ChristianOrr/madnet-deep-stereo-with-keras).\r\n\r\n## Training \r\n### TF1 Kitti and TF1 Synthetic\r\nTraining details for the TF1 weights are available in the supplementary material (at the end) of this paper: [Real-time self-adaptive deep stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05424)\r\n\r\n### Synthetic\r\nThe synthetic model was finetuned using the tf1 synthetic weights. It was trained on the flyingthings-3d dataset with the following parameters:\r\n- Steps: 1.5 million\r\n- Learning Rate: 0.0001\r\n- Decay Rate: 0.999\r\n- Minimum Learning Rate Cap: 0.000001\r\n- Batch Size: 1\r\n- Optimizer: Adam\r\n- Image Height: 480\r\n- Image Width: 640\r\n\r\n### Kitti\r\nThe kitti model was finetuned using the synthetic weights. Tensorboard events file is available in the logs directory. It was trained on the 2012 and 2015 kitti stereo dataset with the following parameters:\r\n- Steps: 0.5 million\r\n- Learning Rate: 0.0001\r\n- Decay Rate: 0.999\r\n- Minimum Learning Rate Cap: 0.0000001\r\n- Batch Size: 1\r\n- Optimizer: Adam\r\n- Image Height: 480\r\n- Image Width: 640\r\n\r\n## BibTeX entry and citation info\r\n\r\n```bibtex\r\n@InProceedings{Tonioni_2019_CVPR,\r\n    author = {Tonioni, Alessio and Tosi, Fabio and Poggi, Matteo and Mattoccia, Stefano and Di Stefano, Luigi},\r\n    title = {Real-time self-adaptive deep stereo},\r\n    booktitle = {The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},\r\n    month = {June},\r\n    year = {2019}    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bibtex\r\n@article{Poggi2021continual,\r\n    author={Poggi, Matteo and Tonioni, Alessio and Tosi, Fabio\r\n            and Mattoccia, Stefano and Di Stefano, Luigi},\r\n    title={Continual Adaptation for Deep Stereo},\r\n    journal={IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)},\r\n    year={2021}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bibtex\r\n@InProceedings{MIFDB16,\r\n  author    = \"N.

model was introduced in [SpeechT5: Unified-Modal Encoder-Decoder Pre-Training for Spoken Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07205) by Junyi Ao, Rui Wang, Long Zhou, Chengyi Wang, Shuo Ren, Yu Wu, Shujie Liu, Tom Ko, Qing Li, Yu Zhang, Zhihua Wei, Yao Qian, Jinyu Li, Furu Wei.\n\nSpeechT5 was first released in [this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/), [original weights](https://huggingface.co/mechanicalsea/speecht5-tts). The license used is [MIT](https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n\n\n## Model Description\n\nMotivated by the success of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) in pre-trained natural language processing models, we propose a unified-modal SpeechT5 framework that explores the encoder-decoder pre-training for self-supervised speech/text representation learning. The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder.\n\nLeveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder.\n\nExtensive evaluations show the superiority of the proposed SpeechT5 framework on a wide variety of spoken language processing tasks, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, voice conversion, speech enhancement, and speaker identification.\n\n- **Developed by:** Junyi Ao, Rui Wang, Long Zhou, Chengyi Wang, Shuo Ren, Yu Wu, Shujie Liu, Tom Ko, Qing Li, Yu Zhang, Zhihua Wei, Yao Qian, Jinyu Li, Furu Wei.\n- **Shared by [optional]:** [Matthijs Hollemans](https://huggingface.co/Matthijs)\n- **Model type:** text-to-speech\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** [More Information Needed]\n- **License:** [MIT](https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/blob/main/LICENSE)\n- **Finetuned from model [optional]:** [More Information Needed]\n\n\n## Model Sources [optional]\n\n<!-- Provide the basic links for the model. -->\n\n- **Repository:** [https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/]\n- **Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07205.pdf]\n- **Blog Post:** [https://huggingface.co/blog/speecht5]\n- **Demo:** [https://huggingface.co/spaces/Matthijs/speecht5-tts-demo]\n\n\n# Uses\n\n<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->\n\n## Direct Use\n\n<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->\n\nYou can use this model for speech synthesis.

(en-US)\n\n<style>\nimg {\n display: inline;\n}\n</style>\n\n| [![Model architecture](https://img.shields.io/badge/Model_Arch-FastPitch--Transformer-lightgrey#model-badge)](#model-architecture)\n|

[![Riva Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/NVIDIA%20Riva-compatible-brightgreen#model-badge)](#deployment-with-nvidia-riva) |\n\nFastPitch [1] is a fully-parallel transformer architecture with prosody control over pitch and individual phoneme duration. Additionally, it uses an unsupervised speech-text aligner [2]. See the [model architecture](#model-architecture) section for complete architecture details.\n\nIt is also compatible with NVIDIA Riva for [production-grade server deployments](#deployment-with-nvidia-riva). \n\n\n## Usage\n\nThe model is available for use in the NeMo toolkit [3] and can be used as a pre-trained checkpoint for inference or for fine-tuning on another dataset.\n\nTo train, fine-tune or play with the model you will need to install [NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo). We recommend you install it after you've installed the latest PyTorch version.\n\n```\npip install nemo_toolkit['all']\n```\n\n### Automatically instantiate the model\n\nNote: This model generates only spectrograms and a vocoder is needed to convert the spectrograms to waveforms.\nIn this example HiFiGAN is used.\n\n```python\n# Load FastPitch\nfrom nemo.collections.tts.models import FastPitchModel\nspec_generator = FastPitchModel.from_pretrained(\"nvidia/tts_en_fastpitch\")\n\n# Load vocoder\nfrom nemo.collections.tts.models import HifiGanModel\nmodel = HifiGanModel.from_pretrained(model_name=\"nvidia/tts_hifigan\")\n```\n\n### Generate audio\n\n```python\nimport soundfile as sf\nparsed = spec_generator.parse(\"You can type your sentence here to get nemo to produce speech.\")\nspectrogram = spec_generator.generate_spectrogram(tokens=parsed)\naudio = model.convert_spectrogram_to_audio(spec=spectrogram)\n```\n\n### Save the generated audio file\n\n```python\n# Save the audio to disk in a file called speech.wav\nsf.write(\"speech.wav\", audio.to('cpu').detach().numpy()[0], 22050)\n```\n\n\n### Input\n\nThis model accepts batches of text.\n\n### Output\n\nThis model generates mel spectrograms.\n\n## Model Architecture\n\nFastPitch is a fully-parallel text-to-speech model based on FastSpeech, conditioned on fundamental frequency contours. The model predicts pitch contours during inference. By altering these predictions, the generated speech can be more expressive, better match the semantic of the utterance, and in the end more engaging to the listener. FastPitch is based on a fully-parallel Transformer architecture, with a much higher real-time factor than Tacotron2 for the mel-spectrogram synthesis of a typical utterance. It uses an unsupervised speech-text aligner.\n\n\n## Training\n\nThe NeMo toolkit [3] was used for training the models for 1000 epochs. These model are trained with this [example script](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/examples/tts/fastpitch.py) and this [base config](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/examples/tts/conf/fastpitch_align_v1.05.yaml).\n\n\n### Datasets\n\nThis model is trained on LJSpeech sampled at 22050Hz, and has been tested on generating female English voices with an American accent.\n\n## Performance\n\nNo performance information is available at this time.\n\n## Limitations\nThis checkpoint only works well with vocoders that were trained on 22050Hz data. Otherwise, the generated audio may be scratchy or choppy-sounding.\n\n## Deployment with NVIDIA Riva\nFor the best real-time accuracy, latency, and throughput, deploy the model with [NVIDIA Riva](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva), an accelerated speech AI SDK deployable on-prem, in all clouds, multi-cloud, hybrid, at the edge, and embedded. \nAdditionally, Riva provides: \n* World-class out-of-the-box accuracy for the most common languages with model checkpoints trained on proprietary data with hundreds of thousands of GPU-compute hours \n* Best in class accuracy with run-time word boosting (e.g., brand and product names) and customization of acoustic model, language model, and inverse text normalization \n* Streaming speech recognition, Kubernetes compatible scaling, and Enterprise-grade support \nCheck out [Riva live demo](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva#demos).\n## References\n- [1] [FastPitch: Parallel Text-to-speech with Pitch

generates audio from mel spectrograms. The generator uses transposed convolutions to upsample mel spectrograms to audio.\n \n## Usage\n\nThe model is available for use in the NeMo toolkit [2] and can be used as a pre-trained checkpoint for inference or for fine-tuning on another dataset.\nTo train, fine-tune or play with the model you will need to install [NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo). We recommend you install it after you've installed the latest PyTorch version.\n\n```\npip install nemo_toolkit['all']\n```\n\n### Automatically instantiate the model\n\nNOTE: In order to generate audio, you also need a spectrogram generator from NeMo. This example uses the FastPitch model.\n\n```python\n# Load FastPitch\nfrom nemo.collections.tts.models import FastPitchModel\nspec_generator = FastPitchModel.from_pretrained(\"nvidia/tts_en_fastpitch\")\n\n# Load vocoder\nfrom nemo.collections.tts.models import HifiGanModel\nmodel = HifiGanModel.from_pretrained(model_name=\"nvidia/tts_hifigan\")\n```\n\n### Generate audio\n\n```python\nimport soundfile as sf\nparsed = spec_generator.parse(\"You can type your sentence here to get nemo to produce speech.\")\nspectrogram = spec_generator.generate_spectrogram(tokens=parsed)\naudio = model.convert_spectrogram_to_audio(spec=spectrogram)\n```\n\n### Save the generated audio file\n\n```python\n# Save the audio to disk in a file called speech.wav\nsf.write(\"speech.wav\", audio.to('cpu').numpy(), 22050)\n```\n\n### Input\n\nThis model accepts batches of mel spectrograms.\n\n### Output\n\nThis model outputs audio at 22050Hz.\n\n## Model Architecture\n\nHiFi-GAN [1] consists of one generator and two discriminators: multi-scale and multi-period discriminators. The generator and discriminators are trained adversarially, along with two additional losses for\nimproving training stability and model performance.\n\n## Training\n\nThe NeMo toolkit [3] was used for training the models for several epochs. These model are trained with this [example script](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/examples/tts/hifigan.py) and this [base config](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/examples/tts/conf/hifigan/hifigan.yaml).\n\n### Datasets\n\nThis model is trained on LJSpeech sampled at 22050Hz, and has been tested on generating female English voices with an American accent.\n\n## Performance\n\nNo performance information is available at this time.\n\n## Limitations\n\nIf the spectrogram generator model (example FastPitch) is trained/finetuned on new speaker's data it is recommended to finetune HiFi-GAN also. HiFi-GAN shows improvement using synthesized mel spectrograms, so the first step is to generate mel spectrograms with our finetuned FastPitch model to use as input to finetune HiFiGAN.\n\n## Deployment with NVIDIA Riva\n\nFor the best real-time accuracy, latency, and throughput, deploy the model with [NVIDIA Riva](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva), an accelerated speech AI SDK deployable on-prem, in all clouds, multi-cloud, hybrid, at the edge, and embedded. \nAdditionally, Riva provides: \n* World-class out-of-the-box accuracy for the most common languages with model checkpoints trained on proprietary data with hundreds of thousands of GPU-compute hours \n* Best in class accuracy with run-time word boosting (e.g., brand and product names) and customization of acoustic model, language model, and inverse text normalization \n* Streaming speech recognition, Kubernetes compatible scaling, and Enterprise-grade support \nCheck out [Riva live demo](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva#demos).\n\n## References\n\n- [1] [HiFi-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Efficient and High Fidelity Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646)\n- [2] [NVIDIA NeMo Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo)", "Rongjiehuang/ProDiff": "\n\n# ProDiff and FastDiff Model Card\n\n## Key Features\n  - **Extremely-Fast** diffusion text-to-speech synthesis pipeline for potential **industrial deployment**.\n  - **Tutorial and code base** for speech diffusion models.\n  - More **supported diffusion mechanism** (e.g., guided diffusion) will be available.\n\n\n## Model Details\n- **Model type:** Diffusion-based text-to-speech generation model\n- **Language(s):** English\n- **Model Description:** A conditional diffusion probabilistic model capable of generating high fidelity speech efficiently.\n- **Resources for more information:** [FastDiff GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Rongjiehuang/FastDiff), [FastDiff Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09934).

Manifest\n\n| [**Github**](https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5) | [**Huggingface**](https://huggingface.co/mechanicalsea/speecht5-tts) |\n\nThis manifest is an attempt to recreate the Text-to-Speech recipe used for training [SpeechT5](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.393). This manifest was constructed using [LibriTTS](http://www.openslr.org/60/) clean datasets, including train-clean-100 and train-clean-360 for training, dev-clean for validation, and test-clean for evaluation. The test-clean-200 contains 200 utterances id for the mean option score (MOS), and the comparison mean option score (CMOS).\n\n### News\n\n- 8 February 2023: SpeechT5 is integrated as an official model into the Hugging Face Transformers library [[Blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/speecht5)] and [[Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Matthijs/speecht5-tts-demo)].\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [SpeechBrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain) for extracting speaker embedding\n- [Parallel WaveGAN](https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN) for implementing vocoder.\n\n### Tools\n\n- `manifest/utils` is used to downsample waveform, extract speaker embedding, generate manifest, and apply vocoder.\n- `pretrained_vocoder` provides the pre-trained vocoder.\n\n### Model and Samples\n\n- [`speecht5_tts.pt`](./speecht5_tts.pt) are reimplemented Text-to-Speech fine-tuning on the released manifest **but with a smaller batch size or max updates** (Ensure the manifest is ok).\n- `samples` are created by the released fine-tuned model and vocoder.\n\n### Reference\n\nIf you find our work is useful in your research, please cite the following paper:\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{ao-etal-2022-speecht5,\n    title = {{S}peech{T}5: Unified-Modal Encoder-Decoder Pre-Training for Spoken Language Processing},\n    author = {Ao, Junyi and Wang, Rui and Zhou, Long and Wang, Chengyi and Ren, Shuo and Wu, Yu and Liu, Shujie and Ko, Tom and Li, Qing and Zhang, Yu and Wei, Zhihua and Qian, Yao and Li, Jinyu and Wei, Furu},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)},\n    month = {May},\n    year = {2022},\n    pages={5723--5738},\n}\n```", "tensorspeech/tts-tacotron2-baker-ch": "\n\n# Tacotron 2 with Guided Attention trained on Baker (Chinese)\nThis repository provides a pretrained [Tacotron2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884) trained with [Guided Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08969) on Baker dataset (Ch).

To deal with these three problems, we propose the Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT) approach for self-supervised speech representation learning, which utilizes an offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for a BERT-like prediction loss. A key ingredient of our approach is applying the prediction loss over the masked regions only, which forces the model to learn a combined acoustic and language model over the continuous inputs. HuBERT relies primarily on the consistency of the unsupervised clustering step rather than the intrinsic quality of the assigned cluster labels. Starting with a simple k-means teacher of 100 clusters, and using two iterations of clustering, the HuBERT model either matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 performance on the Librispeech (960h) and Libri-light (60,000h) benchmarks with 10min, 1h, 10h, 100h, and 960h fine-tuning subsets. Using a 1B parameter model, HuBERT shows up to 19% and 13% relative WER reduction on the more challenging dev-other and test-other evaluation subsets.\n\nThe original model can be found under https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/hubert .\n\n# Usage\n\nThe model can be used for automatic-speech-recognition as follows: \n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import Wav2Vec2Processor, HubertForCTC\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nprocessor = Wav2Vec2Processor.from_pretrained(\"facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft\")\nmodel = HubertForCTC.from_pretrained(\"facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft\")\n    \nds = load_dataset(\"patrickvonplaten/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\n\ninput_values = processor(ds[0][\"audio\"][\"array\"], return_tensors=\"pt\").input_values  # Batch size 1\nlogits = model(input_values).logits\npredicted_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)\ntranscription = processor.decode(predicted_ids[0])\n\n# ->\"A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXIST\"\n```", "reazon-research/reazonspeech-espnet-v1": "\n\n# reazonspeech-espnet-v1\n\n`reazonspeech-espnet-v1` is an ESPnet model trained for Japanese automatic speech recognition (ASR).\n\n -

Experiments using all labeled data of Librispeech achieve 1.8/3.3 WER on the clean/other test sets. When lowering the amount of labeled data to one hour, wav2vec 2.0 outperforms the previous state of the art on the 100 hour subset while using 100 times less labeled data. Using just ten minutes of labeled data and pre-training on 53k hours of unlabeled data still achieves 4.8/8.2 WER. This demonstrates the feasibility of speech recognition with limited amounts of labeled data.\n\nThe original model can be found under https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/wav2vec#wav2vec-20.\n\n\n# Usage\n\nTo transcribe audio files the model can be used as a standalone acoustic model as follows:\n\n```python\n

Qiantong Xu, Vineel Pratap, Jacob Kahn, Ann Lee, Ronan Collobert, Gabriel Synnaeve, Michael Auli\n\n**Abstract**\nSelf-supervised learning of speech representations has been a very active research area but most work is focused on a single domain such as read audio books for which there exist large quantities of labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we explore more general setups where the domain of the unlabeled data for pre-training data differs from the domain of the labeled data for fine-tuning, which in turn may differ from the test data domain. Our experiments show that using target domain data during pre-training leads to large performance improvements across a variety of setups. On a large-scale competitive setup, we show that pre-training on unlabeled in-domain data reduces the gap between models trained on in-domain and out-of-domain labeled data by 66%-73%. This has obvious practical implications since it is much easier to obtain unlabeled target domain data than labeled data. Moreover, we find that pre-training on multiple domains improves generalization performance on domains not seen during training. Code and models will be made available at this https URL.\n\nThe original model can be found under https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/wav2vec#wav2vec-20.\n\n# Usage\n\nTo

The license used is [MIT](https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing SpeechT5 did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model Description\n\nMotivated by the success of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) in pre-trained natural language processing models, we propose a unified-modal SpeechT5 framework that explores the encoder-decoder pre-training for self-supervised speech/text representation learning. The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder.\n\nLeveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder.\n\nExtensive evaluations show the superiority of the proposed SpeechT5 framework on a wide variety of spoken language processing tasks, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, voice conversion, speech enhancement, and speaker identification.\n\n## Intended Uses & Limitations\n\nYou can use this model for speech conversion.

Implement the `pipeline.py` `__init__` and `__call__` methods. These methods are called by the Inference API. The `__init__` method should load the model and preload all the elements needed for inference (model, processors, tokenizers, etc.). This is only called once.

There is also a seperate development set containing 1609 speech segments from 33 languages, validated by at least two volunteers to really contain the given language.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nSee the [SpeechBrain recipe](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/voxlingua107/recipes/VoxLingua107/lang_id).\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nError rate: 6.7% on the VoxLingua107 development dataset\n\n#### Referencing SpeechBrain\n```bibtex\n@misc{speechbrain,\n  title={{SpeechBrain}: A General-Purpose Speech Toolkit},\n  author={Mirco Ravanelli and Titouan Parcollet and Peter Plantinga and Aku Rouhe and Samuele Cornell and Loren Lugosch and Cem Subakan and Nauman Dawalatabad and Abdelwahab Heba and Jianyuan Zhong and Ju-Chieh Chou and Sung-Lin Yeh and Szu-Wei Fu and Chien-Feng Liao and Elena Rastorgueva and Fran\u00e7ois Grondin and William Aris and Hwidong Na and Yan Gao and Renato De Mori and Yoshua Bengio},\n  year={2021},\n  eprint={2106.04624},\n  archivePrefix={arXiv},\n  primaryClass={eess.AS},\n  note={arXiv:2106.04624}\n}\n```\n\n### Referencing VoxLingua107\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{valk2021slt,\n  title={{VoxLingua107}: a Dataset for Spoken Language Recognition},\n  author={J{\\\"o}rgen Valk and Tanel Alum{\\\"a}e},\n  booktitle={Proc.

The total amount of speech in the training set is 6628 hours. \nThe average amount of data per language is 62 hours. However, the real amount per language varies a lot. There is also a seperate development set containing 1609 speech segments from 33 languages, validated by at least two volunteers to really contain the given language.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nSee the [SpeechBrain recipe](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/voxlingua107/recipes/VoxLingua107/lang_id).\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nError rate: 6.7% on the VoxLingua107 development dataset\n\n#### Referencing SpeechBrain\n```bibtex\n@misc{speechbrain,\n  title={{SpeechBrain}: A General-Purpose Speech Toolkit},\n  author={Mirco Ravanelli and Titouan Parcollet and Peter Plantinga and Aku Rouhe and Samuele Cornell and Loren Lugosch and Cem Subakan and Nauman Dawalatabad and Abdelwahab Heba and Jianyuan Zhong and Ju-Chieh Chou and Sung-Lin Yeh and Szu-Wei Fu and Chien-Feng Liao and Elena Rastorgueva and Fran\u00e7ois Grondin and William Aris and Hwidong Na and Yan Gao and Renato De Mori and Yoshua Bengio},\n  year={2021},\n  eprint={2106.04624},\n  archivePrefix={arXiv},\n  primaryClass={eess.AS},\n  note={arXiv:2106.04624}\n}\n```\n\n### Referencing VoxLingua107\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{valk2021slt,\n  title={{VoxLingua107}: a Dataset for Spoken Language Recognition},\n  author={J{\\\"o}rgen Valk and Tanel Alum{\\\"a}e},\n  booktitle={Proc.

A mood lighting system, in addition to the aforementioned features, can be implemented to make user's environment a bit more user-friendly, and and so contribute a little to maintaining the user's mental health and overall welfare.  [Goal 3- SDG]\n\n- Additionally, the model can be trained on data with more class labels in order to be useful particularly in detecting brawls, and any other uneventful scenario. An audio classifier can be integrated in a surveillance system to detect brawls and other unsettling events that can be recognized using \"sound.\" [Goal 16 -SDG]\n\n## Limitations\n\n-The open-source MESD dataset was used to fine-tune the Wav2Vec2 base model, which contains ~1200 audio recordings, all of which were recorded in professional studios and were only one second long. Out of ~1200 audio recordings only 890 of the recordings were utilized for training. Due to these factors, the model and hence this Gradio application may not be able to perform well in noisy environments or audio with background music or noise. It's also worth mentioning that this model performs poorly when it comes to audio recordings from the class \"Fear,\" which the model often misclassifies.\n\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 0.0001\n- train_batch_size: 64\n- eval_batch_size: 40\n- seed: 42\n- gradient_accumulation_steps: 4\n- total_train_batch_size: 256\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 100\n\n### Training results\n\n| Training Loss | Epoch | Step | Validation Loss | Accuracy |\n|:", "anton-l/sew-mid-100k-ft-keyword-spotting": "\n\n<!-- This model card has been generated automatically according to the information the Trainer had access to.
